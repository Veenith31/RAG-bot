"He didn't reply, didn't come online yet.",Who?
Shridhar,Ok
Already written 20 programs asking chatgpt again it's showing the older ones only,OK bro... I think they need just 10 programs that's it... They won't specify anything
How many you guys are completed in the DSA lab? Or observation book?,Haha 😂
Haven't written 10 again.,30 bro
Executed all?,I think you should write 10 bro
She checked?,Ha yes
Can you send me the index if you have? I'm getting the same programs,"Yeah,  they are not specific about the programs,  they are specific about the numbers bro 😂"
🤦🏻,We have wrote just sample programs bro
Hmmm,But I repeated some programs from the previous sessions
There are many right,Hmm ok
Bye bro gotta go then,Copy the C programs in DSA bro
Sure,Hi bro
Hi,Any update in DS group
Nothing yet.,OK bro
Which one?,Stack concept
Wait........,Ok
That's all,OK bro thanks
welcome 🤗,Bro any updates in DS group
Nothing bro,ok
Bro wrote DS assignments?,Assignments?
Not done?,Yeah
Let's see,Sure bro
Bro solved aptitude?,"Bro I am doing some leetcode now,  I will solve by today night?"
Tried getting into but feeling bored from it 😅,Haha ok
I can't study anything in the evenings or at night only in the morning,Haha OK bro
Anyway it's not useful for me.,Why bro
Warm up for? 😅,Yes that is also correct
I tried few with chatgpt fuck everything has some formula to solve. I can't remember any of them.,Maybe for your future interview aptitude rounds
"I won't be having any aptitude rounds in Linux bro. Direct interview with a good resume. Aptitude is used on campus only, when they are taking a huge chunk of students. To filter it. Off campus they won't ask for it.",Oh OK understood bro
It's one of the reasons why I chose the Linux domain. I can't keep up with maths shit anymore 😅,Haha 😂😂 Ok
Will you attend tomorrow's classes?,Oh OK
Test confirmed?,I will try to leave after the placement training
Think in Boolean. Like me.,No not tomorrow
Oh yes i remember now then it's ok.,Yaa
🤣,Haha Yes or No like that should take holiday for the whole day or
"Yes. I'm coming to placement training tomorrow, this is confirmed. Like that. 🤣",Need to come for whole day
Alright then!,Ha OK bro
I won't miss OS 😅,Haha OK bro come come
Maybe I should ask Sharath sir to my mentor 😅,"Ha yes bro better ask him to change, then you will get some kind of benefit"
"Hmm yeah, others don't really understand fully what I'm trying to do. He might get it.",Yeah yaa 100%
You guys need to hurry out. Contact that senior and get as much info as you want. 2nd semester is only 3-4 months away.,Yeah bro I found myself a path to DSA but for project I need some guidance
Maybe mentor can help,My cousin is also doing a project. Let me see if he can help me out
On? Which project?,He took Java as the core language
Alright.,Hmm yes bro
If you are going through the same thing then you should get help from him also. Take help from all sides. Time is less so you can't work alone.,"Let them cope up with the basics,  then we may start"
What is shridhar doing? I know varun is trying with html along with C.,"Don't know bro, that guy is making fun of everything"
"Yeah 😂 that's true He said all about that crypto, IOT, block currency, cyber security and others but don't know what he is working on?",Even I am learning react and brushing up javascript
Great 😃,100% yes
Hmm.,"OK bro if possible you also join bro,  u can have this on the other side"
If it's within my hand I would definitely join.,OK bro
"Back in 2022 when I was working. I regret not working on this. If I had, i would be ready to get into the job I needed.",Oh OK nice nice
😔,Oh!
"Ok bro you might be busy, I will leave you with your work.",Haha ok
"Okk, get your sleep then.",OK bro bye
Bye,Hi bro Have you solved the paper?
😅,Coming bro 😀
Okk.,OK bro
Important,Google form right
"Yes, answer it.",Ha submitted bro
The one they sent in group?,Both bro programs and compiler
"I talked with the OS sir today, and told him about my project. He said if needed any help. Also there are some people in college who know Linux, even, they would help if needed. And to start from now only, he said.",Hah
He said no need to change mentors. As he will be there to help if needed.,Ha OK bro nice then
How was the training?,Ovv
Oh got it now 😀,OK bro
And are you coming tomorrow?,OK bro
Okk.,Bro I am outside....i will reach home by 1 hour
Send me later only.,Yeah
If it isn't do I need to do it? Or continue with tomorrow's programs?,No bro not labset prgms
Alright then.,ok
I don't remember fully.,Ok
I have written shortcuts as  they are simple concepts. Even you may remember these concepts.,OK bro
"So hop me in if you do anything in C. Any way we might have to do some small C projects this semester. Along with it C helps me to dive deeper into Linux, it helps to write code for drivers and kernels. So I need to learn it. So that's why I decided to learn.",OK bro
How is your project going on?,"In this semester we have to do some projects in c, OK bro we will do that"
Yeh.,"Now I am focusing on web development bro. I am learning react js and mongo do for that,  it takes like 2 weeks from now. Then I will be starting the project from scratch"
I was working on automation today. But the whole day went to it only 😅,Automation means?
You mean web development?,Oh OK bro nice
"It's unfortunate, you have to work for college projects also and work related too. While time is limited.",I have took some topics for project like  1.Augmented reality. 2. And a clone like Netflix
"I have done a very simple one like the netflix, using a simple html and css and Linux server, I hosted it and was able to watch it on mobile and TV browsers.",And some more ideas I am fetching
Doing a clone of Netflix is fine I guess.,Hmm nice bro
"It was Linux oriented, so it was a very simple one and basic use of html and css 😅 nothing classy. <This message was edited>",Yeah with some good UI and db with some additional functionalities
"When you do it add me in too, i will mean designing for it maybe css and bootstrap. Also I too need to learn db.",Sure bro for front-end design will be using react and some css too. We will collab and will do
Just state me the date when it's time. I too shall join the project.,Yes bro
Ok.,Duration maybe we can completely within 2 weeks if we are actively in
We will finish as fast as we can if there are no hurdles from the college.,Sure bro ok
Yes.,OK bro
Is the port necessary to run locally?,Let me try
Have you tried restarting the system?,I tried afternoon and restarted just before 10 mins not working
I think port has issues,OK bro
Vite's default port is 5173 which spells VITE if you think about it. Notice the commit branch was named 'vite-port-riddle'.  Is the 5173 correct port?,Yes yes correct
Are you using a live server environment?,"For 3000 port number, I have to use another command and install the node packages again and I am doing it now"
Try,Ok
Worked?,No bro
That's the limit of my knowledge. Couldn't help 😞,"OK bro,  I will try again"
Got it now?,Nope
Same error?,Yes
So what are you going to do?,Let me try some other ways
Ok inform if you succeed.,Sure bro
you are not in OS group?,I am there bro
ok you are not in DS right?,Yeah not in DS
this is for C1 and C3 <This message was edited>,OK bro
No leave tomorrow right?,No bro But I won't be coming
Why? Tomorrow also festival?,Yeah bro for us jallikatu is there
Ok then.,And non veg function tio
Got it. 👍🏻,OK bro
Got it?,OK bro
Can you tell me here? Or tomorrow? Which is easier,What bro? I didn't get what you mean
Solution?,I have modified that port number to 3000 from 5173 and it is running and If it also not works sometimes means I may run the command(npm run dev)  on cmd
So 5173 is the default port number they have given? And you made it 3000?,Yeah correct
"Hmm ok. I needed to know, network concepts are important for me. 👍🏻",OK bro.
My brain worked for a month correctly.,Oh really ok
"I was at home for almost 2 years doing nothing, now suddenly into learning so my brain got tired 😫 i guess. 😅",Ol
I didn't even concentrate this much in degree or anywhere else.,Haha OK ok
So I gave today a rest.,OK
On the bright side I went for a month straight ☺️,Haha really...ok
Actually it all started when I got a startup idea. Imagining all those workloads my brain started going off 😅,Ohh really nice bro...
Slowly.,What is the idea about?
Technology is updating so I want to provide services to them.,👏nice
Well I'm gonna need some developers....... 🥳,Got that one
"Not that, UI/UX, applications like that.","OK,  then if you are OK, I will come in after I am fully thorough"
I will try to complete learning creating OS by this sem. From next semester I will try to work on that.,"After some good grip in some technologies, I said I will definitely come in"
Sure.,OK bro then I will be coming in
I don't know who all are need. For now I think application and UI/UX developers and OS developers are needed. Need to know who else is needed.,"Yeah ya,  first let's be ready with the plan idea and all, then we will jump in"
Alright.,"Definitely bro,  I will not"
"I don't know what your learning process is. But my learning process, learning along with practicals. Like to learn Linux I don't go through tutorials or books much, I like to implement myself and learn. I'm more of a practical guy. So it helps me a lot. So if I were supposed to develop some apps for OS using C. I learn the basics of C and try to develop small apps. Like that I like to learn along with doing. I don't prefer to learn all and do.",So I am going with firebase
"What I'm trying to say is, if you are okay with this plan you can proceed the same way. This plan has worked for me even at work. So it might be forced you. But if you don't think it's good enough you can stick to your methods.",Yeah that was right and even I am also doing that way only
"Oh, wow.","No bro,  not like that"
Okay.,Sure bro
Good 👍🏻,😍
Haven't sent any today.,OK bro I will
This,OK bro
We did both programs today.,Yes
There might be indentation errors in the 2nd program. Be careful of it.,Which one?
First 2,This is done already
Not this. Infix to postfix. Evaluate postfix.,We have executed those
"I have sent you, check.",Ok
Temp++ is the correct one.,"Yeah, I will always do this thing and I have rarely used temp +1 or i =i+1 like that"
Okay.,OK bro
"Testing we can do, or get someone outside to test it.",Yeah naybe
"6&7 also can be managed, although it will be overloaded. But we can manage as there is still time.  Documentation takes more time. I have worked very little in documentation writing.  Managing a project, we can do it normally how we talk.","Yeah 6 and 7 can be done,  managing we can"
"We can, given that we have 2 years till college completes.","Yeah yeah, I think u can handle"
I hope 😇,OK OK bro understood
"Ask me tomorrow about documentation and testing, i will try to explain what I did in it. It's simple yet no problem in knowing. I think I never talked about these things.","Is there any organization,  who have implemented this idea in the market"
"Might be, we are not definitely first. But given the tech is evolving, people are buying smarter things there is always a great opportunity.",Yeah yes yes.
That's a thing to think about later. Let's worry about the learning stuff.,Yes bro ok
Pitch me anything you get anytime.,Sure bro I will do
Sure,Ok
In class ma'am have only given properties. Not any program to do.,CSS properties bro
"Oh okay, so the main content of the page can be anything?",Yeah anything on our own
"And apply the properties ma'am has thought in the class, that's all?",Yes yes that's it
Okay then.,OK bro
Look at the timetable 😭,100000%
Don't know who asked 😭,😔😔
Timings?,11 to 1
I don't wanna sit alone,"Like 10:45 u come to metro station,  I will meet you there bro and we will go jointly to college"
Ok sure.,OK
"Hi bro, where did you work from internship? and how you got it?","I worked in a company called Grassroots private solutions in Domlur . I was randomly applying on LinkedIn for internships,  and I cold mailed the hiring person regarding my project and my grip over programming languages and interview got scheduled and that process went on..."
"oh great. So, you worked on programming languages there?",Yeah yeah some basic react and java like that
or any acknowledgment?,"Still not yet , I messaged the team,  they said that there is some problem going with the company. But we will provide as soon as possible like 4 days back"
Oh.,Yeah
need money 😅 so getting info to know about it,You wanna do internship now
"If I get, I would be happy! But I don't have any skills 🥲","Oh bro,  you do have,  ur thinking while solving any problem is in next level"
"Thanks bro, but what's use of any skills if it can't generate any money.",And startup requires more of development skills rather than DSA
"Oh, I didn't know about it.",OK bro
Hmm. LinkedIn is full of scamming jobs,Yeah some of those
most bro. When I search part-time or internships it will only display copy paste jobs which is obviously a scam.,Yeah yeah even I experienced it.
"Yeah, will check that.",OK bro
Yes. I'm in mantri metro,OK bro
Are you in college?,"No, I will be entering majestic metro in 5-10 mins"
Okay. In 8 mins i will be at the national college metro,OK bro... Ping me after getting off from metro
I have,U r in national college Metro Station now
Yes,OK bro I am taking metro now
8 mins then.,Yes
"I'm outside the metro station, near the parking lot.",Coming bro

Then who might take the class?,Classes are there except web
Will c ma'am take early?,Don't know bro I will leave the class after 2
Alright 👍🏻,"I got to know,  but I am not ready for that"
Running late?,Coz just now I left from malur
Okk.,Got up late
Room number?,I think the same one
Number?,Yes yes
Okay 👍🏻.,OK bro
I woke up now,Oh bro OK
What happened in class?,"OS some theory Maths 2nd module completed, started 3rd module and she asked the concepts that we have doubts so she will clear that tomorrow."
Maths ma'am will clear doubt tomorrow?,"DS recursion topic started. Web some prompt, alert kind of conceprs"
😳 wonderful!,Haha
I thought they might give next month end.,Even my reaction was also same
Need to prepare for maths then.,Yeah even all the subjects
<Media omitted>,In group now they have put some Message regarding time table and deleted
Why again they are changing?,Haha we can manage bro don't worry
So nothing important today?,Ha that's it bro
Okk.,OK bro
Who is seema nagaraj?,Placement coordinator
We are supposed to bigger and dynamic programs!,Yeah she sent some msg
with the supercomputer that we have been provided.,😂🤣😂🤣
C?,Yes bro
DS,OK OK bro
They were also?,🤣
Only way to escape from him.,Haha yes correct and I escaped from that conversation luckily
He consumes everything around him! 😁,Yes
Yes!,Yeah
Ourselves?,Not to the point bro
How was it for your brother?,"They are not giving like proper notes,  we need to make using the pdfs they have sent"
Oh!,I think the assignment questions are enough I think
But i got it now.,"Definitely we need to make OS notes,  maths we can manage,  and the rest"
Only math is given right?,He makes and gets notes from some coaching institutes like that
Got it.,"Yes, I think OS sir sent"
Alright!,DS ma'am asked us to write assignment or to do a project based on DSA
Oh! I'm excited 😆,If we do some beginner friendly project that would be fine I think
We can! Right?,Yes on DSA topics not the web dev
We can choose our own topic?,Yeah yeah
Got it!,She asked to meet her if we are doing project
"OS is a theory subject, I'm guessing it won't be.","Don't know bro , let's make simple notes and we can elaborate while tests"
Sure 👍🏻,OK
Which one?,Dsa project
I will,Even I will search too....
Let's talk about it tomorrow........,Sure sure I was thinking about that
Alright then 👍🏻,OK bro
"tell me if you got any topics for DSA? I want to know the limit that we need to have in the projects. All I am getting from google or ChatGPT is either small like calculator or big like networking projects. So, I'm confused a bit.",I got some projects using circular queue based like performing enque dequeue operations
I'm just asking!,"Like a bank queue system or in a library if we want we can add , delete and display the information"
That sounds great!,Yeah but we can go little bit deeper if we dive in
Right!,These are like basic I think  bro...let's think even better ideas
let's see.,Yeah yeah
Is it individual or group? ma'am told anything?,No she didn't say about that
Oh God! they get everything faster!,OK bro sure For this project what will be the concept used?
means under DSA concepts only we can explore networking side. Even something like editor can be made by C using queues concepts.,Yeah they said in mentor meeting
It also includes memory management.,Yeah yeah
Sure we can.,OK let's get even more ideas and we finalize one
Alright.,OK bro...
"We can make a cloud, to drop a file and access it from the server.",How's that
Or we could make an editor (no networking concepts),OK
"Instead of the web programming, we are doing in C that's all.",OK OK tomorrow give me a idea of that...
😆,OK do you have an idea of which dsa topic would be used
We need to use queues to store the file maybe in local memories and then send it to the server.  Need to research.,OK bro
Ma'am done? I'm not aware of it.,No no not yet
Ok let's see.,OK bro
Probably!,OK bro
Today which concepts did the DSA ma'am did?,Recursion started
Okay 👍🏻,Just some fibonacci and factorial numbers recurrence relation and tracing have been done
That seems simple then. Got it 👍🏻,ok bro
"It's just the beginning, we still have a long way to go.",Nice bro. Started writing code?
Started writing basic codes to see how it's working. Not into the project code yet.,OK bro
induction ended?,I didn't go to college today
Oh why?,I got up really late
so did something? today?,Just saw how the code is working for the project
which code? chat application?,Yes
"See what all required to develop the application, and work on that.",Yeah yeah even I wrote the prerequisites needed and made a blue print on how it works and needed things and
good,Yeah sat and wrote that some sample pseudo code
I'm planning to write a documentation on the project.,"OK bro,  I came to my brother's room now to take laptop, I will send you within 15-20 mins"
Alright!,👍
on Sunday?,Need to see bro
"You travel daily, right? are timings different daily?",Sunday some trains will be cancelled that's why
Oh alright!,Yeah
My family member needs to travel.,OK bro I will check
Thank You!,<Media omitted>
Got it 👍🏻,OK bro
In the docx file,Yeah
It looks so stupid honestly,Not because of their msgs
Are we coming to college to attend functions? 🤪,Because of those technical talk
They are forcing us but I don't think they will actually do that if we don't go. They know we won't take risks in that.,Oh shut
Well I have to now.,What to do bro.... Why they are being this strict I don't know
Can't work on the project now.,Yeah even I was planning to focus on that
Can we leave during lunch 😆,9:30 to 4
They know how we think 😔,Yes yes
At which time tomorrow you will come?,Like 9:20 I will be there in metro station
I'm not sure If i could sit through from 9:30 to 4:00 😔,Yes bro because attendance counts for every session itseems
Yeah got that,There will be some breaks in between... So
I will try then,OK
I know but till 4:00 🥶 from morning,At what time you will come?
I will try before 9:20,But with their strict rules what we can do
We should try this one first and if we have time we can look out for more features.,Hey bro sorry for ghosting you. I was busy on a call.
Ghosting 😆 I'm hearing it for a first time Means ignoring?,"OK bro, please suggest some resources for that"
It's alright no worries!,It's a genz term like ignoring someone for some time or
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basics-file-handling-c/,Ok
I too am a genz but don't know any of the genz terms. Maybe because I don't use instagram so don't know about them 🥶,Yeah this will be great to start with...
More features also include encryption and decryption. Are you aware of it?,"Yes yes.....shall we incorporate web concepts for UI and some basic features and we will write the working function like storing,  sending, retrieving using  DSA in C language"
"I'm not sure about whether we can do that. Never thought of it, so never researched it. Are you sure that's possible?",Maybe bro....even I know some simple words that's it
I haven't seen anyone using the web to develop UI for c applications. C has its own things(I'm not aware of it completely) that I have seen developers using.,Maybe.... Shall we discuss with ma'am about this or
They wouldn't know about it.,Can we implement those features using C? I am not aware of that
I believe it's not possible. Those technologies run on the browser and we are running C on the local machine.,Oh OK bro
If it was possible then people would have studied both.,Yeah
Let me check once with chatgpt.,Ok
We can use HTML and CSS as UI while c works as a backend.,Yeah bro even I got the same
"It's not feasible for us, it will become more of a web project then.",Yeah C and Java always works on the back-end. Only Javascript works on  both.
If you are keen on using web technologies then we can. I would say you too focus on the UI.,"Yeah yes right,  to implement the functionalities like what if this condition don't work, do the other one or some validation."
Right.,Yeah like transcripting right?
We are storing messages in a file. That shouldn't read by any other user by accessing the location of the file. So when we are saving in a file we need to encrypt the message so that no one can understand it. And while receiving it on the user end it needs to be decrypted.,Like that or?
"Sure. I will, it comes under networking.",Sure bro then I will take that job
"All I'm saying is, I'm giving the right to decide which way, i will be okay with it.",Yeah now I got the idea..... Basically security thing..... I got the idea
Yeah.,Bro I will be taking care of UI bro
It will be better if we divide our jobs like that.,Yeah yeah and later on we can explain each other how we did this and It will make us strong in those concepts also
Sure.,Yeah ✌
Probably like this.,Sure bro... Let's do thar
Okay that's all from me.,OK bro.
"I need time, probably this week, i will try on Sunday and show it next week.",Like showing the idea to ma'am
Try to learn how to implement a UI with C.,Yeah I will search on that.... I will come up with the idea tomorrow
Alright then. Anytime else we need to talk about?,"Sorry bro I didn't got you.,"
"Our morning calls used end like ""anything else to discuss"" in the work.","Oh OK bro got you now. I think that's it for now. We will figure out with the idea,  if we are stuck anywhere we will discuss on that"
Alright then.,Yeah yeah 100%
Haha really.,"Yes... Since I worked in a startup... So we are conversing with the regional language and the people like there were the same. So I couldn't catch u said... So,  now I remembered yes corporate people talk like this"
Probably I should use more of my corporate knowledge in the college 😆 It might help in some things.,Yes yes haha
"I'm still searching for a job. Haven't got any. I will include C as the main thing in my resume, maybe then I can probably get.","Oh OK bro. If you get like you have to work on-site,  will you accept? Or do you want a remote one"
I would probably prefer remote until both sems end.,OKayyy
"Maybe from the 3rd sem, i can go on-site if time is adjustable.",Yeah even I am planning to do the same... By completing some projects within 1st or 2nd sem
😅,We have to otherwise in 3rd sem we don't actually want to just go to college and do normal stuff
We will get it 👍🏻,Yes bro 💪
We have already started many things so it will definitely help us in the future.,Yes bro
I have arrived.,OK now you are in college or Metro Station
Where are you?,"OK bro, I will be arriving within 5 mins"
Alright,Ok
"where are we with UI? we have to incorporate with C, like exchanging user credentials and messages from the web to the c program (C as backend), If i'm right that's how it works. I'm not looking at it. I'm leaving to you.",Oh OK bro
"also, if you get any info on code competition conducting in our college, share it with me. Anything, any info would be good.",Sure bro
"no worries, take your time. But don't forget to give me updates.",Sure bro OK. From tomorrow I will be definitely work on that
"Then we will show to ma'am if she is not satisfied, then we work on adding additional features.",Sure I will try to finish my part by Monday or within Sunday eve
"I will also check on encrypt and decrypt part. I think I didn't explain about it today, ask me tomorrow.","What and all we need to have in our web page? Like the navbar displaying the operations the end user can have like login, sign up,  about and so on. Then after logging in,  we will have another page showing to send a message within a textbox and the receivers name or Id whatever"
"It would be easy if code in client-side for encryption and decrypt. it wouldn't take much time. But of course to increase the security, we can work more on it (not for project but for our personal gain, we can say that during interviews.)",Yeah yes yes. Should we have to write code for that
Good!,OK
"Work some on it, like reading, writing and appending (important for us).",Yeah OK bro
"this exchange of data's logic part where you should work. For design keep it simple, if we get time we can enhance it.",OK bro sure
That's all the update from me for today.,"Nice bro good to hear this,  from my side, I will be seriously starting from tomorrow as I need some idea we will discuss on that tomorrow. So,  I will be reporting my work from tomorrow"
"Sure. I meant no pressure, just telling you, it's going to fun.",Yeah OK bro ✌️
"If it's completed, we can work on some more projects.",Yeah yes that's right too
"Alright then, if nothing else I'm going to sleep.",Sure bro. Good night
GN,You deleted this message
I'm in chickpete,OK bro
Where are you,In college parking bro waiting for you
Okk,U?
Looks cool!,"Used HTML, CSS for this."
That's great 👍🏻 That was required in our project. It will send the current time into the c program and save it there.,Nice then
Why not?,"Sure, then"
You finish it then. Later we can look at the C code.,And I got to know that we can connect our C backend code with Java Script and make it functional.
We are on the right schedule.,with the use of CGI kinda like API.
Looks good though.,"Can u make it simpler, i didn't get that"
"I'm not sure anything about it, so asking.",I still don't have much idea about that. I just saw how to connect  a code with frontend.                                     We will work on that
Ok let's see.,No idea bro
"Our c program will take more time. So, i took this into consideration and asked. We don't want to spend more time designing that's why. <This message was edited>","Yeah yes yes, absoultely right"
The pages already look better than just a simple plain terminal display.,Yes yes .
I will probably be busy tomorrow.,Did you went to see the house?
"Oh, we did.","Ok, whenever we get free, we will look o that"
Yeah.,Rent was same or different?
Same. 17 k.,Oh nice
Not 1100 as they mentioned.,Oh ok
Given the place and price that's okay.,Nice then!
Malleswara lands sells hot here.,haha yes you said yesterday
Yeah.,Oh
And I'm not getting any work soon.,Oh Ok
"I know, I even said I would give 7k per month for 4 months from my remaining money, till then i will improve myself and find some job to pay afterwards. He didn't agree with that either. He doesn't trust me that I earn money.",Oh man!!
I'm living 😞,"It's OK bro,  time comes, nothing to worry."
Hope! That's the only thing that's saving me daily.,"Yes, yes let's work hard and get that no matter what"
"I believe in myself and succeed too. But I won't forget this time ever. The need for money, never felt like this.",Yes bring
And get a good job 👍🏻,Nothing like that
"When you said about the 12 lakh package someone had got, i wanted to cross at that moment. And I still want to too. That's why all this hard work. We both should break that 12 record.",100% bro let's put our everything into it
We can Include more technologies in it. I'm still thinking what we can do? Something big. That also must be related to us.,"Yes bro,  let's finish this as soon as possible. We will work on something big"
The idea itself should be unique and rarely done. Something like that.,"Yeah bro, we have to enhance,  let's think about that"
Also we should take project members only if they have certain skills.,Yeah that's what important
"Like if we are required for a particular technology, ex: C. They should be knowing it. We can't take someone and let them learn during the project from basic. <This message was edited>",Yeah yeah right!
"Let's see, i will check with chatgpt also.",OK bro
Anyway it's getting late. You have to play cricket tomorrow morning so bye.,Yeah bro bye 👋
"If you have any doubts, ask me.",OK bro
"This is related to clouding. It includes the cloud services concepts. Like scalability, which the last speaker spoke about. Do you remember it?",Yeah yeah getting that
working wait a min,OK bro
No bro  I didn't come,OK bro
You are not in class?,I am
<Media omitted>,No bro I am in claas
I have gone but don't remember much what they used to ask.,Don't know bro
Okk.,Why you didn't come bro?
Nothing like that.,OK
I will afterwards,OK
Sowmya ma'am sent this,OK bro
Tomorrow is there a DSA lab test?,Yeah ma'am informed
First 2 programs?,To get blue books without fail
Blue or yellow?,Sorry yellow 😂
Infix to postfix and evaluate postfix right?,Right
This,Is the logic complex or understandable?
Have to see.,Lab
When should we submit that?,"Don't know bro,  she didn't inform anything about this in college"
What are we talking about?,BTW DS 2nd module completed today
Linked list?,Ma'am did a Lil bit complex and lengthy program to end the 2nd module
Which one?,"Some tower of Hanoi or recursion kind of problem,  I will send you evening"
So this has nothing to do with tomorrow's test right?,"Important :- you have to sign the undertaking form tomorrow and get it  signed with your hod and mentor,  they will give  a slip kinda,  that you need to show bro"
We attended....,Morning OS sir also asked itseems
Then what's the point of attending all.,Ma'am said
I ain't doing it. I will see tomorrow what it's all about.,OK bro I think tomorrow they will forget
Let's see.,Yes bro
What did we ma'am do in class?,"Even I felt very bad,  that Vinay was absent for just one session,  then also web ma'am asked him to give the letter"
Let's see.,"Nothing bro , half an hour went on this undertaking only and another half an hour she was sharing her life stories"
What 🤣,Yes
What's her life story about?,I think she didn't prepared for today's class
Tell me about it tomorrow then 😆,Haha nothing interesting bro
I meant if she shared any educational or career related things.,She didn't tell about tht
"Hmm, i thought of asking about it, in the near future. I'm interested in those things actually that's why.","I think she is doing,  I saw in college website"
Okay.,PhD?
Yeah.,Nothing bro
I like to know the extent of knowledge a person has or can have.,OK nice
It could help us to know about technologies that we might not have heard of.,Hmm yes yes right
But the rules allow only 3 per college.,Nice
Won't you participate?,OK
I'm thinking of coding and quiz.,What was that competition about?
"Coding, they will give you a problem and you code it. And the quiz is just a tech quiz I guess.",OK
They have registration fees. In my degree college they used to pay the registration fees. Don't know whether BIT will pay.,OK how much?
*200,You are always. OK that's also correct
We may clear the first round. Depends on the final rounds.,OK bro
Really 🥺,"Yes,  SIT is in tumkur"
"Starts from 9 in the morning, we can't.",Hmm we can't reach at that time
Offline only.,Yes I checked now
That's why they have mentioned the place as college.,Yes
It will take hrs to reach there.,Yeah minimum 2-3hrs from Bangalore
"Okay, let's wait for the next, then.",OK bro
Ok,Let's participate if any
Sure,👍
Class room number!,Same
312 right?,Yes
For yellow book,It will open by 11 bro
Lab at 10,"Wait I have one,  I will give you"
Oh thank you very much 😌🙏🏻,😊
I will buy more just for the future from the store.,"I will come by 9, but I have to write observation"
Web?,C
Came early for the book 😅,OK bro
Bro you know what is proctor?,No bro
My mentor has asked to fill the proctor today or tomorrow. So don't know what it is. Need to check with him tomorrow.,"OK bro. I think that's a mentor book,  our mentor was saying about that but I don't know much about that"
"Maybe, I will check tomorrow.",OK bro
Now everywhere AI.,OK its nice
All three use the same AI.,Yeah yeah
Yes!,Haha OK
But for realistic best AI has to be X's Grok. (Free),Oh OK I am unaware of that
"All AI always mistakes Indians as just brown skin and similar looks. But man, Grok can easily make variations in Indians.","Oh that's nice bro,  I will try it"
10 images per hour I think.,OK 👏
"It's because they didn't mined Indian data very well. That's why, Indians all look the same.",Interesting nice
"Check it once, it worked for me.","Ok bro, this looks lil bit easy, i will check"
Yeah it's easy.,Ok bro
"Yes, it's about research papers, i didn't know anything about it.",Same here
No use for us for now. We are writing papers right now.,Yes
No sleeping now 😴 Will see morning,Ok bro. Now only you slept
😅,Oh ok bro. Even i couldn't work anything today.
I understand 👍🏻,Ok bro
What was he doing?,"Yes, i was shocked, nobody noticed him"
You met or you were passing while you saw him?,"I was in bus, and he was waiting in a bus stop"
In majestic?,"I thought of calling him from my bus, but cou;dn't"
Oh okay.,Yeah
"Missed opportunity, but can't help if you were in a moving bus.","Yeah,"
"He is 5,7 i think",Maybe
"No, he is 5,9 it seems, Virat's height.",Oh OK
Send me your instagram id.,You deleted this message
Hmm,crazylad3008
Requested,My internet is fucking i don't know why
Haha it's acting weird.,Done bro
"Hike messenger failed due to its way ahead of time features, we could make our own chat application and sell it as India's own chat application or with unique and simple features that hooks up Indians. Another start up idea. We should keep updating our chat application more and more. Who knows tomorrow it might become what I'm saying.",Yes that's right
6th floor.,Ol
You?,Ok
<Media omitted>,Saw the video
"The reference, I meant.",Bahubali.... I didn't get it
"There were other girls filling the book, So I left.","Oh shit,  these girls"
"Sorry I messed up the grammar, bear with me 😅","100 %, his aura never vanishes"
Yeah,Yes
"In mantri, I just missed the metro.",OK bro
<Media omitted>,Bro who took last class
OS,Oh shit
He started the 7th chapter when there was only 2 mins left.,OK bro
Yeah after everyone started to ask to take attendance then he took attendance and left us. <This message was edited>,What about attendance
DS ma'am asked about you.,At what time you guys left college then?
"Don't remember, a couple of mins late I guess.",OK
"I remember now, 10 mins later he left us. <This message was edited>",OK bro I think I was absent for the first Dsa class
Maybe that's why she was shocked.,OK bro
Nope.,"Start it bro, because we need to submit within 5th"
"I have to learn them, then only I can write them.","No, actually when you write, you can learn bro. So do that."
Will see.,Ok
<Media omitted>,Notes?
Okay.,OK
Will you attend maths class?,Yes bro
😔,Oh bro now people have come
Okay leave can't do anything now.,Oh
1st class late.,Otherwise I would have called you
Attended lab.,OK
Ok bye bro.,Haha OK bro
Any idea syllabus for test?,I didn't attend the morning class today
"Don't know why I'm not getting the forward option for it. Maybe because I'm on a mobile network, let me check once I get a wifi network.",Just some graphs bro
Ok got it.,OK bro
I have wifi issues so I'm choosing an easy one - C,OK bro
"Anyway ma'am have sent both modules, so no need for internet.",Yeah OK
Are you starting?,Yes bro
Alright 👍🏻,and side by maths
I keep maths at the end.,Too much is there so
"Hmm, i don't know anything so wasting time on one is not feasible for me. So i will prepare for all, and will try to pass in math.",OK bro
What will I do there?,Bro have to submit by Wednesday
Let me try with chatgpt once and see.,Oh really
Let me try with gpt once. If not I will ask you.,Sure 👍
Math.,Ok
Anything we need to show tomorrow? What about the OS assignment? Where should we write it? I'm confused between the blue book and the normal note.,By miss call came
Okk. 😅,Pressed by mistake 🤣
Got it.,Ok
Notes 😛,Yeah
I can understand 😄,🥰
Yes!,OK
Is attendance updated on the website?,Mee too especially OS
Ok.,Ok
Just 3?,All 3
It's coming..........,OK bro
Network is too slow 😔,It's OK bro
"Fuck jio man, even 5G is so slow every where nowadays.",Yeah even here
<Media omitted>,Yeah
Sent all.,Yeah got it bro
No problem!,😀
Bro are you there?,Yes bro
Do I have to learn the whole 2 modules of C?,Yes bro
What is the thing she sent now?,She sent some questions
For tests or anything else?,Yeah for test
"Oh, that makes things easy then.",<Media omitted>
Okay.,I think this is for test important questions
Okay got it,Yeah
Okay then i will read that only.,OK bro
"what is L2, L3 mentioned in the docx that maths ma'am have given?",Don't know bro
Not related to the questions right.,No I think
Okk 👍🏻,OK bro
Just listing is enough .,"Row, column, square,  scaler, diagonal and more bro"
OKAY.,OK bro
Do we need to add anymore questions?,No this is for our reference
The test next week?,Maybe YES
7 1/2 😅,Yes
😔,Really
Yes.,No bro I just thought like that
Bro can we use black gel pen for record?,Black pen is ok
The one I have is gel. Is it okay?,Maybe OK I think
Oh,Oh OK
Okay then I'm getting worried unnecessarily I think.,Haha why bro
Alright then 👍🏻,Oh OK yes you said on that day
Yes it keeps happening 😢,OK
Which subject are you preparing for? Today?,Some math concepts bro
You know 😉,2nd module got some idea
Okay.,👍
It's not hard right?,Not much
Okay,OK bro
"For the pigeon hole principle, after explaining it, do we write the example also?",Yes bro
Okay,Just write m and n values and evaluate
<Media omitted>,Nope this is explaination right
"It looks so big, that's why I'm asking.",Start from generalization
"After explanation, ma'am have for eg and started this. In the 1st line.",OK then write it
And proof also?,No no
Oh then okay.,She will not check that much
Got it 👍🏻,OK bro
Hi I have completed the 1st module except for 1 question. In 3 or 4 questions in the 2nd module. Will you give me your book during the break? I will complete the remaining?,Sure bro no need to ask
Bro filled the form?,Yes bro
I haven't,"OK do now,  even I did nos"
Done.,OK bro
https://youtu.be/yU3HqFyj2DI?si=GTLMzxOl7zydZ5FR,What is this about bro
We are lagging behind 😔,Oh nice
"Someone from the US, their accents seem like that.",😂
"We shouldn't compete with them, who are taking 5-6 l packages. 😅",Let's finish these useless exams and let's start
Like them.,Yes bro
Only 3 people did that one note.,That's more like gpt right
Probably Haven't used it yet. Just got a recommendation from YouTube.,"OK.... Even I just saw their YouTube video now,  so it felt like that"
"They mentioned in the description, only 3 students have come up with it. That too in the US, where there is a huge market competition. We could do a lot better in India.",Yeah yes yes
Competition is much less here compared to the USA. But investors are very less here.,We have to build something unique
Need a good way to track our progress.,Hmm yeah
Are we going slow or at the right speed.,"I think a Lil bit slow,  we should work and generate ideas even more efficiently"
Also we shouldn't compare ourselves with our college. We should have a higher aim.,Yeah then only we can stand out from the traditional crowd
Getting ideas is easier than coding.,Yeah yeah
Yep.,Yeah lots and lots of time goes there even if we have AI to help
True.,Yes
"I think we should better our project very fast for marks sake. Then once ma'am accepts it, we should onboard some more who can code. And work on our project.",Yeah that's correct
"Like in companies, we just don't work on a single project. There will be times where we will work on different projects parallelly.",Oh OK
"Suppose we finish our current project, we can add some more members who are genuinely interested in the project and can work on the ideas currently we have. Along with this chat application, we can also work on the P2P project parallel. It's going to be hard, but we gotta make time for both.",Yeah got to know about that from a podcast
You have anyone in mind? My social connection is too small 😅,"Yes OK, I think we two can  finish chat application"
Finish as in for college? Or the whole project which we thought of making it as a complete application to release in the market?,Can we involve Varun? But still he is learning C it seems he said yesterday
We can in future if he gains knowledge faster. For now we need someone who knows C.,Ok
"For college, we 2 only need to do. But for the whole idea we need more members.",Yeah
And remember don't share about the final visions we have about our chat application like start ups or anything like that. Just sharing ideas is okay.,"Yeah, even I didn't share about the idea also"
"Man, I never thought our class members were so beginners like me. 😅",Only Varun knows the idea that's it
It's okay.,Mee too😜
It's going to be hard for us. To select and make them train😔 <This message was edited>,Yeah
Who is that?,"I don't think he will involve ,"
Why?,Front bencher
Ohh,Actually Shridhar was asking some doubts before the tests itseems and he was like please don't disturb me I can't help now like that he said
Oh god really?,"And even while writing lab tests,  he literally scolded him"
We better not get involved then.,Yeah that's what I was about to convey you
"Yogesh, Vinay? Are they good?",Grounded people required
Oh,"Because Varun asked him to join his project and he said OK like that then he gave something to code,  then vinay didn't replied for that from past  2 days"
Haha the point was more important.,"Bro he is more interested in teaching like that. Let's try,  let's ask him"
I felt that too.,"Yeah, let's try once"
"He is good at math, so coding should be easy for him.",Bro math how bro
He does solve math problems.,Yeah he is good at it
They are all inter related.,"Logic is OK. What if someone just learn the formulas and score just for marks? I agree with you, but"
Try explaining coding to a person who hasn't studied math. And explaining to a person who studied math. The former will have a hard time while the latter will get it easily.,Yeah that's correct
Haha I can't comment on that.,Let's approach him
Sure.,More people are like that and even mee too
I'm trying the same method. Good at math doesn't necessarily seem to be getting good marks. Someone who can understand and solve problems faster is a good mathematician.,"Even I scored 97 at math,  but logic building sucks bro.  The person who studied some advance maths would have the ability to build logic I agree"
"That's what I believe marks don't define a man's knowledge or skills.  I got 62 and 67 in 10th, and PU that too in commerce.",As of my knowledge I think like that
"Right, and I'm not able to understand when ma'am teaches, that's the difference.",Hmm OK
But you see our class members are from science backgrounds more than commerce. Even though commerce students also would have studied BCA.,Yeah bro I said that math logic and programming logic will be definitely difficult. But they can easily get into it
"Science students taking up CS, sure says lot about it right? <This message was edited>",Yeah yes
"Probably, I'm no master in math. 😅",Math students
I do have.,OK
Don't know where I have kept bro. You need a link for that?,No I have to try that
Same model.,OK I will have a look
Product is average for me. Even with a good phone the clarity was just okay for me.,Oh OK
"Don't believe those games and movies stuff they are showing, it all depends on your mobile's screen quality. Otherwise you will see pixels through it.",😂 oh OK
If you want something for fun you can buy VR.,Yeah yeah even I was thinking the same
Like watching ghost videos or height videos like that.,OK bro
This was the movie I was talking about that day.,When?
That's all my little brain could remember.,Even I forgot bro 😂
"Just watch the vid, you will get it.",OK ok
I'm sure you will get traumatized too 😅,Oh OK then I will try to watch by today or tomorrow
There are five movies.,Oh then it takes time
Yeah,Oh then I got some interest I will start from today
Oh,Haha 😂 fearing inside
Try 👍🏻,Oh nice
You can give it a try.,Oh OK
"Try the final destination, if you like it i will recommend you some more.",Yeah but I haven't tried any
For the web what you did in the lab? What we need to write in observation?,Some Java script programs bro
Has ma'am given the programs?,And sum of N natural numbers
It's already done in last lab.,Don't know bro
Hmm okay then.,I think next labset programs we have to write like that they said
Okay I will look it up then.,OK bro
Anything important in today's classes?,Ha yes bro some important questions for C
The ma'am sent in group?,"And DS didn't do class,  she asked if we have any doubts"
"Oh, so left early?",No she took one hour
"Okay, got it.",Yeah
Got it!,DS?
This one.,Both the questions looks  similar
"Oh, okay 👍🏻",This is similar to the one she gave today
Got it,Bro saw the message in group
Saw,About the attendance
For SIP also,Ok Bro
Tomorrow timings?,Don't know bro
Will they say?,Yes
Okk.,Maybe
Let's see,OK bro
Is there a dress code?,Nope
I will wear the same dress.,OK bro
"Haha who knows, will wear what I get.","OK bro,  plan if u have a black color dress"
"I don't have it bro, you know my relationship with the sun. So I don't own black.",Haha 😀yes OK bro
Related to kernels?,Yes
It must be related to kernels only then,Yeah yes
"I didn't study anything today, probably will pick from tomorrow.",You went home early?
"Head headache, still have.",Sure 👍
It's my usual business 😅,At what time you will be coming tomorrow?
"Will leave 8 at home, probably reaching at 8:40 or more.",OK bro
Outside metro,National College?
Started?,I will be reaching majestic in 5 mins 😂
Oh,Yeah
Okay come I will wait,OK bro
Ping me when you leave metro,OK bro
I'm near Indira Gandhi canteen,OK bro I am coming
Okay 👍🏻,OK
Are you still in the college?,Left just now bro
Ma'am has told to bring yellow book.,Took one from shreedhar
Will it be available on Monday?,I have asked for me
He has?,Yes
Okay.,Yes they took 5 yesterday
Okay let me put a message to him then.,We can buy remaining on Monday
Okay,Ok
I have put up a message too.,OK bro
"I know, that we got it from an unofficial group. But no message from the main group.",Nothing bro
Cool 👍🏻,Like that they said
Or you meant participation is 2?,"No,  to participate in the event only two members team should be made not more than that"
So shall we both be a team?,Yeah
Only 2 teams can win it.,"Don't know bro,  not yet announced"
"Oh they will announce about it, it would be easy if they do.",Yeah
"Only 2, i have gone to different colleges, every where they used to be winners and runners only.","OK,  let's wait till they announce officially"
Okay.,Don't know bro
Okay.,They said within this month ending
"Oh, then the week after the test. I think. <This message was edited>",Yeah maybe
"I read the c reference book, it really got great stuff. Such topics will come in other languages too. You already have a library card you might consider taking that book. It can help for projects as well as for other programming languages too.",OK bro I will try to take on Monday
anything about it? <This message was edited>,No bro
if you get 4th edition it would be good.,Preparing bro
for C which we need to study? the txt file or or the doc with the name proc.,Which subjects completed?
I was wondering out the reference book,Doc? Send me that
😅,Haha
<Media omitted>,I think this one is good and structured
Oh,I will be going through this
2 modules right?,Yeah
"Oh, really! Okay I will also follow this.",OK bro
Okay got it,"I was stuck in THIS OS bro,  now I have to start math and tomorrow C"
"I haven't checked out it yet, I will help you if possible, on the test day. At what time you will come to college?",9 or 9:30
"Okay, I will try to come at 9. <This message was edited>",OK bro
"Ping me your OS question if you got any, I would prepare for it.",OK bro I will list out and I will send you
"Not just OS if you got any doubts in any subject ping me, I will also if I get. It would be better if we exchange our comprehension skills.",Sure bro
or you reading from the pptx?,I am going through the assignment questions
is it available in the group?,I will send you
Okay,<Media omitted>
C is very much easy and web too. DSA looks difficult to remember different things.,Add scheduling problems to it
Have to check OS now.,OK bro
"I just went through DSA, even though we know the concepts but still there is a high probability that we may get confused between topics, with OS test on same day. It proves it more difficult.",Yeah
program code?,Yeah and similar usage of concepts
Hmm. Need to manage somehow.,Like linked list and circular queue
"I feel it's better we get programs, at least we could trace and correct the program. But theory part we can't do that. We have to explain it correctly; we can't get confused. And also the infix,postfix stuffs can make us confuse.",Yeah yeah
"It is manageable, at least better than theory.",Yes bro
are you having problem with linked list and circular queue?,Yes
"Okay if you don't get it, remember to ask me on test day. I will explain from what I have understood. If you understand it, you can understand the program or you can write your own. <This message was edited>",OK bro I will ask you if I don't get it
Any other doubts?,Nothing as of now
For maths I will prepare for the assignment questions. Which is easy I work on it. Trying to get passing marks.,Even mam said those questions are enough
Okay got it.,OK bro 👍
Who will be sitting around you? You checked? In tests.,Yeah
Probably Varun will be in front of you.,"No bro I have to be in honest in exams, to know my ability. 😂"
A single piece of paper doesn't define my future.,"If I fail also I don't even care about that, it should be my own effort"
"Oh, your mindset is like that. Then nobody can change it 😜",Yeah yeah understood
Failures need to attend extra classes. You know that right?,"It just came in my mind and I just said, I am not very honest and serious on that saying though"
Yeah 😂,Some days before right
Yes.,"Hmm,  but I don't stick to one <This message was edited>"
Life will make you.,Maybe <This message was edited>
Maybe I'm giving too many philosophical lessons 😅,Nothing like that bro
Sure 👍🏻 To my extent.,OK bro
"Planning around something for the project, will tell after the tests.",If you have anything in math ping me
Haha definitely. You know I won't even attend maths classes if you are absent. 😅,Haha 😀
"If not, I will not come early .",Yeah associativity and precedence
Checking.....,I know the problems but theory I have some doubts
Oh okay.,Long before
Maybe 🤔,You studied about this concept
"Haven't fully, but I will go through the paper once now.",OK bro
Okay 👍🏻,OK bro
With functions,String functions
Yes,Yeah she asked to study both
"Okay, will see now.","And searching, sorting?"
Yes.,Nice bro
"No worries, we would have options, we don't need to know everything.",Yeah
😭,I am worrying about DS
Let's see.,OK bro
Help me for maths during the break.,Sure bro
For?,Math and C
Okay.,For detailed solutions
I took for C. Especially for theory part.,OK bro
ok.,Which concepts you have studied more?
spent today only on maths. now going through C questions.,OK bro nice
nothing more or nothing less.,Ok
Bro checked metro prices?,No bro
Mine from 17 -> 30 😑,Oh shit
For one ride?,Yes
Yes 😭,Doubled the price
We need to bleed money,😟😔
Yes,Yeah
I'm coming to majestic in a min.,"Stuck in traffic bro,  will reach college by 9:45 max"
It's okay anyway it's C.,Oh ok
621,OK
Oh for all tests? Same?,Don't know about that
Ok,Okay bro
Got permission from the HOD.,Nice bro
You arrived?,Left market now in bus
Oh 😯,Will reach within 10 mins
Okay 👍🏻,OK bro
do you know?,Abstract data type
if asked what I supposed to write for it?,That shows what need to be done but hiding how it should be done
"Okay, I will check it.",She explained in starting
Okay.,"No programming example given,  just one real world example"
Okay.,OK bro
starting now!,OK bro
OS I will see tomorrow.,OK bro
Which one are you using for tests?,What bro?
I meant which pen?,Black
"Yes, he told for us too. But I wrote in blue.",Nothing will happen
Have to use black today,OK
I still need to have my food.,OK bro
"I will late only, DSA took my entire morning",Prepared linked list
Only single linked list program That's all,OK
"I will leave linked list, we haven't practiced much on linked list, so i thought it's better to understand what I know, then trying to understand all and making it confusing.",Yeah
I think we can manage with options,Yeah even I am too thinking like that
🤣,Got some glimpse
Have to read this afternoon. Couldn't read yesterday,Have to revise in the Brea
DSA took too much of time,Yeah even me too
Reached college?,Nope bro
Ok,Hi bro
Im still in home,No bro just asked
Fibonacci?,Ok bro
"Even if they give, they will give small programs",Object creation and like the data object
Is that in the assignment questions?,Yeah date object is there
Did I read the wrong questions then?,<Media omitted>
Right?,Yeah
Then why PPT?,Just I saw some reference
Oh okay,OK bro
I haven't read anything from the ppt,OK everything is covered in assignment itself
"A lot of folks didn't get time to work on Javascript in the lab, so I don't think they will ask more from javascript",Yeah correct
.,Hi bro
Why?,Tomorrow we have lab do
Oh,"So,  should we have to write and go"
Did ma'am mention it? Checking tomorrow?,OK
Okay,OK bro
"Haven't worked on the project today, slept through the afternoon.","Some of our lab mates are writing now,  so I have to"
Haha 😆,Ha
Shall I register?,Yeah bro
It's turbo C. So if I find any issue I hope you know how to work around the editor. <This message was edited>,Yeah
Veenit - is that right?,Any rules in team
It's given above the pic.,Veenith Kumar S
See.,OK
Your details,Yes bro
Okay.,How much is the registration fee bro?
100,OK I will send mine
<Media omitted>,OK bro
They kept too hard.,My share is 100 right?
That's right.,"Yeah mcqs, debugging, writing code"
"Yeah, I never saw this much in a competition.",Its OK let's give our best
MCQ will be based on C only right?,Yeah
Don't forget they are offering a 1 month internship. We have to win 1st for sure.,Everything will be of programming
Great.,Yeah yes
If you get any more information regarding it share it with me.,OK bro
For finals only 5 teams get selected.,"Yeah that will be competitive yet, but we can"
And points depend on 6 test cases. So our code should be perfect.,Oh OK
Yes we can.,Yeah ✌
Okay got it,👍
Tell me if you have any,Like development
5 mins,Ok
It will be interesting.,Yes
"Also I think web based might be difficult for people right now. As till now web technologies are done very less. Don't you think so? Even I know only html and css, haven't worked on javascript. And probably forgot the backend thing.",Yes even I am thinking that
I think web development won't be feasible for all. As it requires multiple technologies to get prepared.,Individual creativity matters there right in designing a page whether they may use React js or any frameworks or simple html  cs see
I got that.,Yeah but many people have done projects on that in BCA
Related to techs.,Yeah let's do this after first sem
I'm searching for other events held by other colleges,OK I
"Tell me, I'm interested in.",Ok
<Media omitted>,What I meant is the money we get from participants from an event
I didn't get it.,"Cash prize is within 5 or 10k,  but collection goes too faarrrr"
College would take that.,Oh really
I mean we are technically using their place and people for competition 😅 So I don't think we get that money.,"Event organizers will take that right,  because they have put all their efforts and they take permission from college and they would give some amount for college"
I felt like this. 😅 But i really don't know how things works.,"We can give some amount or kind of share to the college for the place,  people"
Never thought about these things 😅,"This is some foolishness from me,  let's get ready for the event"
It would be good at the end of the day 😊,"No no I am thinking like that now,  why am I getting some unwanted useless ideas 😂"
"Everyone organizes events, but ours should be different and people should talk about it 😅",Yeah bro I will think
😂,😂😂 that's a great idea
Ma'am was absent last week and no classes this week. So don't know what we should do tomorrow.,Don't know bro
Okay I will see what they will say tomorrow.,You have to do next Labset I think
Okay then.,OK bro
Feeling a bit down.,OK bro
Anything important?,Nothing bro. DSA 3rd module started and maths some concepts done and
"Yes, why?",Javascript
And other subject marks they told?,Coz of exams
Oh,"I will be coming,  attendance is low already"
I need to check mine,Oh what happened?
Oh,Like fever or body ache
Headache,OK bro take care
Sure 😊,Ok
😔,Oh shit I didn't even checked
I was checking for our project,Ok
Still a lot of work is due,Oh
And not much time left,Actually C ma'am also asked to do a mini project
Group?,And a team of 3 is allowed
That's great,Yeah
So you thought anything?,Yeah let's search for  a guy
I love projects 😅,"Actually Varun, Yogesh,  Vinay were planning to make a team"
"Okay, what about the topic?",Haha
"It's alright, even if we don't find anyone I think only both of us are sufficient. We can pull that off.",Anything related to C
Yep 😊,Yeah let's do
I will search for it today then.,It seemed more interesting when you actually explained
Okay.,OK bro Even I will also search
Sure.,OK bro
"Yeah. But we can ask if anyone is interested in the project. If not, then only we can do it. Cause you know ""The more the merrier."" <This message was edited>",Merrier?
"I believe once we finish DSA, we would gain a lot of knowledge. So it will be easier to do for the next project.",Yeah OK bro
Merrier as in merry Christmas - means Happy,Oh nice
3 can do a lot that's why I said.,Yeah got it.
Either way we should be able to do it.,Yeah
Let me research about it then.,OK bro I will also put my hands in
"We are doing project, right? then Why seminar?",Bro she said in the beginning of the course right
😫,No for web seminar is compulsory it seens
I will tell ma'am.,Don't know
"I will ask first whether Project is enough or not. If not, I will tell her I won't do it.",OK bro
Okay.,Ok
We have to meet DSA ma'am tomorrow?,Yes let's give her our names
Ok,At what time you will be coming to college bro
Anything is there?,Let's discuss more about socket programming so that we can understand better
Tell me the time,"Bro I left near baiyappanahalli now, I don't know the exact time because there maybe traffic"
Now? But classes start at 1:30,Who said? 😂
Time table? It's there,"No placement training today , only classes from 11 to 1"
I woke up now,Yesterday HOD shared the PDF also
You didn't mention the time 🥺,In group
I didn't check anything,I thought you would have checked the group
I didn't even know about it moving,"Oh!,  it's OK you still have time"
Will see,OK bro
Room no 618 or changed?,For last 2 classes we say in 621
"Oh, okay.",Ok
You reached?,Yeah entering now
I'm at the lift,OK come to 6th floor
Coming,Everybody is waiting outside
Classroom is closed?,Come back
To?,Near the lift
What to do for the 3rd member of the C project?,Yes bro
"By completing the chat application We would already have the knowledge of file i/o operations, socket programming. Which will help us in p2p but others won't have. So we will get a beginner only, we can use the 3rd person for testing purposes.",Yeah that's right
If interested then we can help with the coding part also.,"Yeah , let's give a try"
That's how a project is done in companies also.,Yes
And we won't be using node.js for our C project.,Yeah that's a better idea
"Although we 2 are enough, but it's better we learn to work with others also. More collaboration = more ideas.",Oh yes we won't be using node js in p2p
Will you ask Shashank?,Yeah
You have his number?,No bro
😅,"OK anyways, we will be completing chat application on Monday right then we can reach him out and ask him"
"Chat will be done tomorrow, on Sunday only testing. While starting P2P.",Haha yes
"I want things to go faster. So, that we can do more",Ok
I will probably start with coding. Once you complete understanding topics you can hop in.,I will ask Varun if he has Shashank number
Okay.,OK sure
"I got one from the group, but I'm not sure if there is another Shashank is the class.",Yeah two Shashanks are there
Which one is the other?,Wait I got his number
Thank God.,I will text him
Do.,Shashank BIT.vcf (file attached)
Inform if anything he says,OK
Okay,"What is a P2P Project? P2P (Peer-to-Peer) Project: In a P2P project, every participating node (or peer) in the network functions both as a client and a server, allowing for direct sharing of resources without the need for a central server. Each peer in the network can initiate or complete tasks and communicate directly with other peers.  Goals of a P2P Blockchain Project:  Decentralized Ledger: Maintain a distributed ledger where all peers have a copy of the blockchain.  Security and Integrity: Ensure data integrity and security using cryptographic techniques.  Consensus Mechanism: Implement a mechanism for peers to agree on the state of the blockchain.  Scalability: Handle increasing numbers of peers and transactions.  Steps and C Concepts Needed Step 1: Understand Blockchain Basics Blockchain Concepts: Study blocks, chains, transactions, and consensus mechanisms.  Cryptography: Learn about hashing (SHA-256) and digital signatures.  Step 2: Set Up Development Environment Install Tools: Set up a C compiler (GCC), text editor (VS Code), and version control (Git).  Libraries: Install libraries like OpenSSL for cryptographic functions.  Step 3: Define Block Structure Structs in C:  c typedef struct Block { int index; char previousHash[64]; char timestamp[64]; char data[256]; char hash[64]; } Block; Step 4: Implement Hashing Hashing with OpenSSL:  c #include <openssl/sha.h>  void calculateHash(Block *block, char outputBuffer[64]) { SHA256_CTX sha256; SHA256_Init(&sha256); SHA256_Update(&sha256, block, sizeof(Block)); SHA256_Final((unsigned char *)outputBuffer, &sha256); } Step 5: Create Blockchain Structure Linked List of Blocks:  c typedef struct Blockchain { Block *head; Block *tail; int size; } Blockchain;  void initializeBlockchain(Blockchain *blockchain) { blockchain->head = NULL; blockchain->tail = NULL; blockchain->size = 0; } Step 6: Add Blocks to Blockchain Add Block Function:  c void addBlock(Blockchain *blockchain, Block *newBlock) { if (blockchain->head == NULL) { blockchain->head = newBlock; blockchain->tail = newBlock; } else { blockchain->tail->next = newBlock; blockchain->tail = newBlock; } blockchain->size++; } Step 7: Implement P2P Communication Network Programming (Sockets):  c #include <sys/socket.h> #include <arpa/inet.h> Step 8: Develop P2P Protocol Message Passing: Define protocol for sharing blocks.  Broadcasting Transactions: Ensure peers can broadcast and validate transactions.  Step 9: Implement Consensus Mechanism Proof of Work (PoW):  c int proofOfWork(Block *block) { int nonce = 0; while (!isValidHash(block->hash)) { block->nonce = nonce++; calculateHash(block, block->hash); } return nonce; } Step 10: Testing and Debugging Unit Testing: Write tests for each function.  Debugging Tools: Use gdb or similar tools.  Step 11: Document and Deploy Documentation: Explain how to set up, run, and use the project.  Deployment: Deploy on multiple nodes for testing.  C Concepts You Need to Learn Data Structures: Structs, linked lists.  Memory Management: Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.  Pointers: Working with pointers and pointer arithmetic.  Network Programming: Sockets, TCP/IP communication.  Cryptography: Using libraries like OpenSSL for hashing and encryption.  Debugging and Testing: Writing test cases and debugging code.  This should give you a clear and structured plan to develop your P2P blockchain project using C. Let me know if you need more details on any specific step! 😊"
Don't share this,Sorry I have tried to send myself so I can pin in messaged
To him.,No nk
Okay 👍🏻,"OK bro double tick is there,  if he responds I will inform you."
Gn,Bro Shashank will join i
What's next?,OK he is online
"You said, we are going to use only C?",Message him once
Great,Nope just messaged him about the description
"Okay, let me say.",OK
Shall I add him to our project group?,Yeah bro do
I'm not good with people so tell me 😅,It will be convenient for us
Okay,OK
I said from Sunday we are starting.,OK bro nice then let's go
Yeah <This message was edited>,🙌
It's weird but true.,"Haha very nice bro,  this is inversely benefiting you."
"I cross verified with geeks for geeks website, chatgpt actually took from that website only.",OK bro any specific changes have you made for better understanding?
I learnt from both.,"OK bro,"
Nothing as of now. I understood line by line what they have given. And coded the exact thing. So no changes as of now.,How you felt with the code?
You can follow the steps I did. Ask chatgpt to explain that program part by part.,OK
"The struct variables and normal variables declared might make you confused and would look complex. It happened to me also, but once I understood, it's not that complex. <This message was edited>",OK Nirmal?
"If you still don't get it, I will explain on Monday.",OK bro
Done.,But I will try my best
Okay,Ok
Message (queue) + file i/o - socket programming = our project. That's all.,"Anyway we worked on queues,  file"
Yes,And I need to learn socket programming completely
Focus on file operations too. It is much bigger than socket programming.,By evening
this is the code I have done.,OK bro I got a good idea on the code.
Are you coming for this?,Like understood the working of code and how it is connecting
I thought you got some idea for the project 😅,"No bro,  actually tomorrow we have to go hosur to get our bike ready"
It's good for us to go. But it's paid - 😬,Haha 😂 But I will give an unique idea wait
okay.,Oh OK
"It's okay, I'm not going too.",OK bro
did you understand my note?  Note for me - Hashing each chunk of data for security purposes.,Adding more security to the user data and their info right!
"I want ideas like this. Otherwise, I'm concerned that only I will get benefits from the project. I want you to think ideas to implement in our project. I'm saying for your own concern. I genuinely want you to learn and get benefits from it.",Hmm I understand
good,You explained this concept in class I think
and this how our project works.,Yeah OK
You can use chatgpt for ideas for our project.,Ok
Yes!,OK bro
"But that's the problem, I don't know how to handle those. I'm good at working alone. So don't know how to divide.","No worries, we can make it and we can divide.  Let's discuss about the project on Monday and we can make it"
You take the initiative.,OK I  will take care of that
ask me for any help then,OK bro
"Actually, I didn't get it. Can you please specify what you meant by peer? <This message was edited>",I am considering a peer  as an user
a user should not the ability to know those details. call?,OK bro
our main.c going to be reduced.,OK
It won't. We are moving those code into client and server codes. We will call functions from the main.c,Yeah that's better
You got it?,Yes bro
Okay.,"If client want to perform certain operations like login or need to send a message, then we are calling functions"
yes from main.c to client.c Now client will handle those functions. <This message was edited>,Yeah got it
server will receive those and store in the server.,Yeah got it
it's getting more complex,Code
main.c is updated. You can test.,OK bro
"Not yet integrated, as of now!",OK
"Once integrated, you can start validations on the project.",OK I will do this
"It's better I only do it, I have come this far. It would be difficult for you go through everything again and start coding.",OK
sure.,OK
It's optional for the project (chat). like notification for the receiver that he has a new message received.,OK we are implementing that in p2p
in chat. P2P has no use to it. P2P is not user to user.,"OK,  you have posted it in main project right so I thought like that"
haha still group is for chat also.,If an peer requests to download a file from the server then it will show that the file is downloaded
"in p2p what is peer In a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network, a peer is a computer system or node that both consumes and provides resources. Essentially, each peer in a P2P network is both a client and a server. Here's a concise breakdown of what it means to be a peer in this context:  Resource Sharing: Peers share resources such as files, processing power, or network bandwidth.  Decentralization: There is no centralized server in a P2P network. Instead, all peers are equally privileged and directly interact with each other.  Network Efficiency: The network becomes more robust and efficient as more peers join, distributing the load and making the network more resilient.","OK I understood that,  I am thinking a peer as a user in my understanding"
no! NO! peer is just a server. It will respond to user's requests that's all.,OK I will go through
There are 3 parts in both of our projects - User Client Server  Here are client and server are considered as Peers,Bro I am stuck somewhere I don't know 😂. I will understand clearly and I will talk to you about this.
"haha it's okay. If you don't understand in messaging, you can call me. Before diving into the project, it's better both of you should know what our project does. <This message was edited>",OK sure
"I will tomorrow. If he doesn't get I will on Monday. But for you if you don't get it, I will do in call tomorrow. Because you already know certain things in C. So, stay ahead.",OK sure
<Media omitted>,I think this will be interesting and director also directed only one film before this like 7-8years back and that's a hit.
🤐,"😂 haha OK bro,  I thought you were asking about the movie"
You gotta observe things 😉,Hmm yes I need to
Explain me with a scenario for better understanding!,"OK,  when a Peer A sends or uploads a file or info to another Peer B then  it can keep account of which file it have been sent to the respected Peer B"
"There are 4 peers. One peer has a file the other 3 don't. From the other, one of them requests for a file from the peer 1. And the peer responds to it (doesn't send or upload, it is purely based on web sockets. One request, the other responds). Now peer 2 also has the file.  Now you are saying that peer 1 should have information of the sent files. But the thing is peer 1 will already have that file in its storage.","Like in UPI apps,  peer A(user 1) can keep an account of how much money he sent and that wouldn't be visible to no one other than peer A"
"There is a first server which will have files, which are uploaded by a user into it. In the same server there will be tracker lists. Which will have the address of other peers. (We are doing basic for now) Now other peer requests for a file connecting to the server. As the tracker has the address of that peer it accepts the connection and provides the files if it has it. After transfer - both servers have the same file now.","OK understood,  but peer A can have all the files,  it may have sent to peer B and peer C.  But in peer A we can keep an account that I have sent 2 files to peer B and 2 to peer C"
Call?,"I think I have tried to explain this,  that transfers can be recorded"
Yes correct 💯,OK bro
For?,Like any course
Oh. How much?,OK I just got an ad and I checked udemy
But discounted can fetch up to 259.,499 rs course is now 3999
Haha it keeps changing. Anyway using Udemy is not worth it anymore. YouTube + AI is enough.,Yes yes I got an insta ad and I just saw the price
Okay,OK
just for reference - chat application,OK bro
I'm taking a break from it.,Really?
"As we didn't know how our project works with the network, we have designed in a way we understood.",Oh
This is the procedure.,Yeah
I'm thinking about how to re-code again. What is the best way?,OK going through it
Instead of saving in local (way easy) we have to send and receive data from main->client<->server So it's going to require changes in our code.  For now only local chat will work.,What this client.h does?
"If you don't get it, I will explain tomorrow.",Yeah got it
"It's affected me, thinking we have to re-code again. That's why I stopped coding. Will do it again.",Take break bro
Maybe we should divide it.,Yeah Spent today on understanding socket programming
Okay,Yeah
"It will cook you too, if you do it alone 😭",😂😂 Haha
That's why I thought and wrote what file should contain what functions.,How will you connect one . C file to another .C file
We have to use the .h file. To call for functions from other .c prog.,Server and client will be connected through port no it will be connected
Correct,OK bro
I have a clear idea of what we should do. But the pain is in coding again. 🥺,Yeah the difficult part
Yeah.,OK bro
We already have 2 other projects waiting to be completed. So let's focus on that.,Ok
It's a library existing in Linux. I think it's for connections.,Yeah for windows it's different
You may install an extension for that.,Yes
What are you doing for that?,"In vscode,  launch json file is there"
Oh god you have to make a lot of changes for that.,Need to configure
#include <winsock2.h> #include <ws2tcpip.h>  // For inet_pton and inet_ntop,Tried already
"Oh, it's still not working?",Nope
Windows is such a pain in the ass 😡 Thank God i left that 🙏🏻,😂😂 I am suffering
For a programmer time is essential. And windows take up a lot of in setting up. But Linux comes with a lot of pre-installed services required for programmers.,Ok
No wonder they both were designed depending on specific users.,Oh really that's nice bro
Yes worked 👍🏻,Yeah bro I have to I think
"To show our project in college, we have to use a fedora machine to run. I don't think turbo can handle our projects.",Not even connected bro
Got it,Yeah turbo can't
Saw this?,😂ha saw now
That's why companies don't use windows when coding is involved. As well as for servers. Windows was always designed in keeping with normal users.,Yeah that's correct
"You can't use the system when it's auto updating, not the case with Linux. You can easily work while it's updating (after you give the permission). And it's so fast in updating too.","Really nice bro, more benefits in linux"
You have no idea how good Linux is. You need to experience that. But it depends on whether you are interested in installing and maintaining Linux machines.,"I have to bro,  but I don't know how to use it"
"Man, you have me with you and you are saying you don't know. I have been a Linux user for 5 years.","Ha yes 😀 , you are there,  need to learn from you for Linux"
Fedora is a flavour of Linux. Means fedora is designed using Linux. So using fedora means using Linux. An interesting fact is the person who made Linux actually uses fedora as his primary OS.,Oh really nice
"It's feasible for companies. First is they know you know technical stuff Second is Linux is freaking free, so companies don't have to buy windows for you 😄",OK bro then I will definitely do. I will have to switch to Linux
Who knows if I get my desired package I don't need to go off campus.,That's nice
The next 4-5 months are going to be hard.,Yeah really hard
Your hard work during these months will give better results in the future.,Yeah that's correct 💯
You completed the record? Any one?,The next labset programs bro
Oh,Yeah C record we wrote till searching and sorting
DSA or web,DSA we wrote first 3
Can you bring the DSA record tomorrow?,OK
"For C I can manage with the ma'am, but DSA ma'am 🤐",Haha ok
It's confirmed 3 members right?,OK bro
Ok then,OK bro
Are you there?,Yes bro
Better voice quality,OK bro
https://youtu.be/zpwj-Um1nbI?si=3Q-FwFfGNBxndBZ_  The show which I told you about. Silicon valley He is talking about decentralised internet.,"Yeah If you have sent this video 2 days before, I would have understood this concept on that day itself. Very informative"
Thought it's not our project 😔,Oh OK
"We can try that too, while explaining to Varun about possibilities in the C project. I thought of this too, but it would be hard to make him understand, so I didn't bring this up.",But the concept he is explaining looks bit similar to our project
"It's a decentralised network, means any authority or government cannot control it. These kinds of projects exist in the west, but not in a country like India. So we can try this too.",Oh OK nice
"Yes because it's decentralised. The usage is different but the core concept is decentralised i.e., P2P.",Yeah yeah
They have mentioned this.,Oh OK Call this number bro 7339722954
Whose number?,Yeah I had the same doubt
Name?,Separate numbers are there for each event
"Yeah I tried for coding, but they are not responding.",Okayyy
Okay.,"Call this guy,  he may know I think"
We can't it seems 😞,Oh nice
Let's win the web then.,Oh shit
Sure.,Haha yes
I will leave home early as we have to go through the hebbal. I will call you then.,OK bro
"Watch this show if you get time, you will learn a lot of stuff like these.",OK bro I will
I'm thinking at 11:00 as we need instructions from the college and also have to find the place.,OK
Yes.,OK I will send the amount then
<Media omitted>,Where is the link?
The qr code one.,Bro sent
"Go through it, click on enroll now. Then you will get the payment link.",OK bro
"I can also help type, but I think it's better you type as you know about it. And also the editor.",Bro if possible have a look at flex and grid
I need to tell you about the competition.,OK bro

Only 4 per college allowed.,Bro if possible can you bring keyboard
"Mine is old and doesn't work well, similar to college. Buttons are stuck. I'm yet to buy a new one.",OK bro
"Yes, it's common for all college completions. They don't want the same college to win everything.","OK,  I think nobody will come except us"
At what time you will reach?,I will be reaching tin factoty in 15 mins
Okay,OK bro
We can't say tomorrow?,Nothing
Then I will tell tomorrow only,Because they will put absent for today and will they change tomorrow or not?
They will,Anyway inform
Otherwise i will inform later,OK
Left bus,Stop name?

Okay.,OK bro
If not I'm filling it.,No bro
I have filled it,OK bro Should I also have to fill it ?
No need as they took teammate name also. I have entered your name also.,OK bro
"Ma'am has sent DSA programs in the group, are those for today's lab? Did Varun mention anything about it?",Yeah quick sort
Okk.,OK bro
And merge,OK I don't have idea about that
I got it from Varun 👍🏻,Haha yes
Explaining things and writing algorithms like that.,Need to explain the tags in the description part
Can you show me?,"Yeah,  any 5-6 tags enough"
With the index too.,<Media omitted>
Ok got it 👍🏻,OK bro
I gave your DSA record right?,Have you wrote DS test in new yellow book or the old one?
"Old only, ma'am gave us.",Preparing bro
😅,Yeah worrying about it
We have to meet her fast.,Yeah
Ok,👍
There were tests so we couldn't. No time.,Oh linked list alone took 2hrs
It did.,OK bro
No I didn't,OK bro
Like varun had to do with his project.,Nope
Instead of single '\' use double '\\' in your code.,Used for setting up C in my laptop
"No, I meant inside the code.",Oh OK... Will this work if we use \\
Yes.,OK bro
Ok I'm going off.,Bye 👋
Which one?,In Varun's project
"I just told him the error now, i checked now only with chatgpt.",OK
"This one -   <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=""en""> <head> <meta charset=""UTF-8""> <meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0""> <title>Paragraph Stacking Example</title> <style> body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; text-align: center; margin: 50px; } .container { width: 300px; position: relative; margin: auto; } .para { position: absolute; width: 100%; padding: 10px; background-color: lightblue; border: 1px solid #000; transition: all 0.5s ease; } .para:nth-child(1) { top: 0; z-index: 1; } .para:nth-child(2) { top: 30px; z-index: 2; } .para:nth-child(3) { top: 60px; z-index: 3; } </style> </head> <body>  <h2>Hover Over Paragraphs</h2> <div class=""container""> <p class=""para"" id=""para1"" onmouseover=""bringToTop(1)"" onmouseout=""restorePosition(1)"">This is paragraph 1.</p> <p class=""para"" id=""para2"" onmouseover=""bringToTop(2)"" onmouseout=""restorePosition(2)"">This is paragraph 2.</p> <p class=""para"" id=""para3"" onmouseover=""bringToTop(3)"" onmouseout=""restorePosition(3)"">This is paragraph 3.</p> </div>  <script> let originalZIndex = {};  function bringToTop(id) { let para = document.getElementById('para' + id); originalZIndex[id] = para.style.zIndex; para.style.zIndex = 10; // Bring it to top }  function restorePosition(id) { let para = document.getElementById('para' + id); para.style.zIndex = originalZIndex[id]; // Restore original position } </script>  </body> </html>",Oh this is lengthy
Ok,<Media omitted>
That's all,Yeah
"Oh, then you have written already in record? You have attended all web labs right?","Yeah,  but we haven't executed 3rd prgm"
Ok.,OK
It will take one or 2 days they are saying 🤦🏻 For a soft copy,😔
Yes i directly messaged in the group.,I did on the first day itself
I kept checking but nothing so messaged them last night.,OK bro
"I would still say your use of the mouse made you slower, during the competition I observed. That's what I wanted to say today 😅 Avoid the mouse to increase the speed.",Yeah bro I have to.
That's not the difference. First of all turbo C doesn't support c99 standard. Next is by using keyboard means using shortcuts which are available more in vim than any editors. While turbo C has none specialized shortcut other than normal ones.,OK got it
What I believe is the mouse makes us slow.,Oh OK
Will work in the morning tomorrow.,OK bro
started working on C project with anything?,Worked on file operations yesterday
"Okay, informed to Shashank also?","And saw how we can incorporate socket into it,  got an understanding of how it works"
"Okay, you guys can divide the job among yourselves.",Like I saw an video on how to incorporate
I'm still coding for chat.,OK bro The socket part?
share it.,Shall I send you the video link
yes.,https://youtu.be/okzEZmnVWnM?si=tcEOLsVDC9fZKjrF
"oh damn, it's in C++",Yeah I saw it because anyway I need not to go with the code. I saw it to understand how the concept works
good,Hmm not sure bro I didn't go till the end
okay,OK bro
classes at 11 so,OK
Me?,"Not sure,  but he asked us to come"
Okay,Ok
Got your fees receipt?,He messaged me today
Alright,Oh shit nope
"Ask your family to send a picture, you can take print out","I have the scanned copy,  I will get xerox and will give them"
Okay,OK bro
Where are you,College bro
Coming,Okay
Class is available?,No
Then,Sitting in corridor
Discussing there only?,Not yet started
"I tried leetcode with 2 easy programs, it was so hard for me crack it and took more time 😢 I'm worried I'm not good at coding yet.",Prepared the problems I have solved in leetcode
yeah,"Because of a long break,  it seems to be difficult"
basic logics I'm taking too much of time.,"If we would have practiced continuously,  it would have been better"
"yes right, but given other works I couldn't practice.",Hmm yes even I too <This message was edited>
let's see what happens tomorrow.,OK bro
I have gone through C mcq's.,OK
"My focus was more on project and how to achieve that, so I'm not good solving problems if given, as I already told you I take longer time to understand a program. From now on I should code on leetcode too.",Yeah even I have to restart solving problems in leetcode
if I can't code simple programs then what's use of the projects.,I felt very low when I saw my DS leetcode notes today
notes? what's that?,Yeah no need of writing the main function in Leetcode
"I didn't know about it. I kept wondering what is the error, it pissed me off so much. Then chatgpt told me. <This message was edited>","When I was preparing data structures online and solving problems,  I would take note of it and I would write the code in a book for my reference"
oh,"Yeah I have to restart,  i stopped in strings"
👋🏻,OK bro Good night
I will be coming late <This message was edited>,At what time bro?
Before 9,OK
Have you reached?,Will be reaching in 5 mins
Okay let me know if any info given,Ok
I'm at mantri metro station,OK bro
You know sort programs right?,Yeah
Okay,"Bubble,  selection and cyclic sort"
Good 👍🏻,I will go through merge and quick sort now
I don't think they will ask that much,OK then
I have arrived,I am in 3rd floor bro
Competition at 6th right?,Yeah coming
Okay,Are you inside?
"No, in the corridor.",OK coming
<Media omitted>,Bro what to do with this certificate. Anyways they have sent that's nice
haha i was joking,Haha 😂
this is worthless,Yes I felt the same
yes!,Nice one
I did personally,OK bro
okay,OK bro
And for those who are not doing the project is seminar+assignment. Right?,Yeah I think so
We have to write the os only then.,Let's ask mam tomorrow
Have you written? Is it long?,Let's ask C mam also tomorrow
For?,Same like Ds
Sure,OK bro
I don't know which programs to write for sample programs.,5 mins
what descriptions we have to write for the programs?,OK I will send you
Okay.,I will send you that also
apply to this,Actually we aren't eligible for this
why?,Only 2025 passing out students can apply
I got it about when they mentioned we can't continue our studies after getting jobs. But ma'am sent this so I thought you should try it.,"No no, just for some information she may have sent"
It's more like she has forwarded it without checking 😅,Yeah maybe
can you send now?,Yes bro sending
okay,<Media omitted>
for other 3 sample programs?,No description for sample programs
Okay,Description need to be written only for labsets
What is that 4th program? I never did that program in lab.,<Media omitted>
is 7 are enough?,I have written like these
okay then.,OK bro
"Leave it's okay, it has a process, it would be difficult to teach from here, So, I will download and make my pen drive bootable device and bring tomorrow, it will be better that way.",No
my course has been updated to 41 hours. 😬 How are we supposed finish these long courses with practical knowledge before June 😪,Yes bro
Coming tomorrow?,Yeah
okay.,Thanks for reminding bro
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphanet,"Saw this, related to our project"
<Media omitted>,Yeah you said about this
Let's see.,Ok
bro coming?,No bro. Expected fever would decrease buy it didn't . So going to hospital
Okay take care 👍🏻,OK bro
Wow great 👍🏻,Divided a 28kb image into each 1kb chunks and again merged them into a seperate file
Good 👍🏻,Time? The executable time ?
Like did it take longer or was it fast?,"It just happened in seconds bro, only because it is a kb file, if i take mb files, it will take longer time"
Because time is very important for projects like these.,Yeah getting it
"Yeah, okay then test for video also then, then check the time.",Ok sure
Oh,with visual studio 2022 community version
Didn't get you,"For this file operations, editor is working. Don't know whether this will work for server, clients socket progra mming"
And remember the divided files shouldn't be accessed. It should be inaccessible.,Yeah
Yes,Ok
Got the other parts 👍🏻,"Yeah the fwrite operation, we can pass parameters into it like the byte_size to be divided and the chink file name it to be stored."
"Okay, got it.",I will send you the code and  you will get to know clearly
"Test the video too, I will see later.","Encrypt, decrypt and hashing"
"Like the divided files shouldn't be accessed, we can probably save the file with no extension. And while merging can add the original file extension.",<Media omitted>
"Yes it would be a problem, so it should be inaccessible.",Yeah yesterday we divided our tasks in group right?
Okay,Sure bro.
It's easy to do. I have done it on my mobile only. Just by changing the file extension.,Ok bro
Then later you can do this.,Ok
Okay anything else?,<Media omitted>
Are you asking me?,"Yeah, any ideas?"
"Okay, you just need to save that file without any extension.","Ok now I have saved with jpg extension, if I remove the extension it would be inaccessible"
"Yes, check it once. Some systems can make it accessible.",Ok I will check it bro'\
So it depends on the system.,Ok bro understood
If it's still accessible after removing the extension then so worries there are more ways to do it. Removing the extension is the easy one. So let's try that first.,Ok
"I will go off now, if possible I will see later or else tomorrow.",OK
Of course you can! This will keep us updated on our project.,OK I will post after the video testing
Sure,Ok
I didn't get this part.,Yeah that's right
"Invisible, means what you did to that file.","Leave it bro I fixed it,  I will explain it tomorrow"
Okay.,Yeah we have to
Explain me tomorrow.,Yeas
I think this week we should focus on chat application as next week is submission.,Ok
"Okay, No problem.",OK bro
"yes, I gave yesterday itself.",Oh OK bro. I am starting now
"It actually takes more time, I wrote some at night, some at morning and remaining in the college during the break.","No,  yesterday I couldn't write. So writing today"
Okay.,OK
That would be irrelevant for submitting assignments. Try submitting tomorrow itself.,I couldn't complete by tomorrow
"You can continue in tomorrow's break too. There are 2 breaks. Cause it's already late, having class or not would not have any effect for submitting assignments, unless it's a holiday.",Yeah OK I will try
"still need to solve 9X9, yet. Tomorrow I will try making changes to chat application.",Oh OK
Tomorrow which lab?,DS?
let's discuss tomorrow.,OK sure
"oh, then merge and quick sort program.",Yeah
"next week, tests again.",Lab tests?
C is easy.,Ok
first 4 programs it seems.,Yeah true
"along with them, we need to write assignments and work on projects with preparing for placements.",😔
"We are giving maximum efforts, but it's not enough.",Yes
I was thinking to take things slow. I had enough of this overwork.,Yeah we need to
"But you guys can't, June it is. For you!",OK even I was also thinking the same
Develop a web page to validate your USN using JavaScript,Ok
okay.,"<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>USN Validator</title> <script type=""text/javascript""> function validateUSN() { var usn = document.getElementById(""usn"").value; var pattern = /^[1-9][A-Z]{2}\d{2}[A-Z]{2}\d{3}$/; // Example: 1RV21CS123  if (pattern.test(usn)) { alert(""Valid USN""); } else { alert(""Invalid USN. Format: 1RV21CS123""); } } </script> </head> <body> <h2>USN Validation</h2> <label for=""usn"">Enter USN:</label> <input type=""text"" id=""usn"" name=""usn"" required /> <button type=""button"" onclick=""validateUSN()"">Validate</button> </body> </html>"
that's all?,I have executed this and it worked
"okay, I'm shocked such a short program.","No bro,  I will try both on and off campus"
"Even, I too. But don't depend much on off by taking things slow. You guys don't have time for that.",Yeah
"Okay, you need to write the OS assignments, I will leave you to that. Bye!",Bye bro
I missed my lab. Going college now,Oh OK bro
What is that?,"Dear Students,  The _*VTU student registration portal is now open*_ . To generate your University Seat Number (USN), please ensure that your details are updated in the portal.  To facilitate this process, please come with the following xerox documents along with one passport-size photo:  1. SSLC Marks Card 2. PUC Marks Card 3. Final Year Degree Marks Card 4. PGCET Rank Sheet 5. AADHAR Card.  Three staff members, _*Mr. JP Umesha, Mr. Anjan Kumar, and Mr. JS Umesha*_ , have been assigned to upload your details to the VTU portal by the *end of this week* . They will be available in the labs to assist you. Please meet with any one of them to complete the upload process.  Thank you for your cooperation.  Dr. Madhu H.K."
Don't they have the origin documents? Then how can we submit?,Posted in main group
I was in class,"They have, but again we have to submit xerox of that"
Anyway I will see tomorrow.,OK bro
All of you bring the hard copy,Yeah
Latest message,I saw this
"No, lunch break.",OK
"Tomorrow, I have to search at home.",OK bro
"In case you forgot DSA ma'am had told us to trace the tower of Hanoi that day, she asked yesterday too. So do it, she might ask today too.",OK that diagram
I also have to do,OK bro
What document do we need to submit for that?,I think the admission order <This message was edited>
Okay thank you,Ok
"I don't find this, but I have claimed acknowledgement document. It would be sufficient I think.",Don't know bro
Let me see.,Then it is sufficient I think
I don't know where I kept my results documents at that time.,Oh OK
Other than that I have a screenshot of my pgcet results.,OK get all those we can give what they may ask
Okay,Ok
It's already time I will take later.,OK
Thanks bro i will do it on Monday 👍🏻,Yeah
"https://youtube.com/shorts/ZqS_lnqSgeY?si=TnJ8A7SuMKWQPMcK   Check out the first project, it might helpful.",Yeah it will help us in our p2p
Yes to segregate.,Yeah
"I have C on Monday, maths on Tuesday and dsa on Wednesday.",OK bro
Okay.,Which one?
"Smaller ones - Matrix, fahrenheit to celcius, factorial and GCD using recursion.",Oh shit I have executed these in lab
We need to write the records also that's why ma'am have sent those descriptions in the group.,Forgot to mention
That's what I thought everyone would have done these programs. We did sorting way back.,Yeah recently we wrote test till sorting so I was in that
Okay,OK
I think I completed the code that day only. And probably sent you to also.,OK bro
I don't remember the remaining bits.,"OK,  socket programming is working on that?"
"Ok I remember now, the network is not working on yours.",OK users are able to connect
Yes the socket is working. I think it has issues with condition statements. And also need to add a queue concept that's all remaining.,OK
Issue as in after login it's not getting a messaging menu.,Oh OK
And be to add validations. That's all our project would be completed.,OK bro
You can 👍🏻,OK
"I got worried seeing this message, thought we still haven't completed the chat. Today I remembered that only a small part is remaining.","Yeah, in this case there maybe error in function or with the switch case and some other maybe"
"If you can give code to chatgpt, for remaining parts. As they are small things. Don't spend much time on it anymore.",Ok
Probably.,OK then I will try to fix
Do testing with chatgpt only.,OK
If you are doing something in P2P please connect with Shashank and do it. Don't wait for me. You guys can continue on it. I will join as soon as I get free.,OK bro better prepare for those
And whatever you both are doing post or converse in the group itself to keep me updated.,OK sure
You know complete Java? Or still learning?,Still learning bro
Oh great 👍🏻,OK bro bring it
Okay.,OK bro I will try that
I searched there is none for Linux. Anyway I'm getting from the red hat so mine is settled.,Ok
"The course might have already started, exams on - April last week I think.",Ohh
Install swayam and check.,OK bro
Anything else? Important?,OK bro take care
Do I need to remember all the law of sets? - I know De Morgan's law and Distributive laws.,Enough bro
Okay.,And revise that previous qp that's enough
okay.,It helps but she may repeat the questions or can change the values
"Okay, will go through it.",OK bro
chat?,Just now came home and got freshed up as today is full day class
Will you bring your laptop tomorrow? for Linux.,Web lab test 4th and 5th program
Okay.,Wait bro I will confirm with my brother whether he needs laptop tomorrow or not
Okay.,If I bring my windows 7 laptop
Installing in older might take some time.,It will not take intenet at faster speed
"Okay, install 32-bit virtual box in it.",OK
I have downloaded the os that day only.,Oh OK right then no internet is required right? <This message was edited>
"You need older one, so it's just 850 mb.",Tomorrow if I bring my old laptop
"Can't say 100%. We might face any problems. Older systems are designed different, so need things to go correctly.",OK will it support the sockets
Means?,You said that the version is older one and it's of 850 mb
Linux is known for it.,Ok
Okay.,OK
My arch linux is just 900mb when downloaded.,Oh OK
Later I installed a lot of things including UI too. It had only terminal eariler.,OK
"If we get the wifi driver correctly then it will be piece of cake. If not, that will be the main problem. You may to use internet connected to mobile via wire.",OK But Wi-Fi works in my laptop
"Getting the right wifi driver is what I have spent most of time while installing linux, for older systems.",Oh OK
People should have written correct code for that particular Wi-Fi drivers using C. We need to install that.,OK
Let's hope everything goes well.,OK bro
"No, you will have UI.","Then it gets difficult bro,"
There will be a way.,OK
yes,There is no errors in server code right?
no compile time errors.,Only errors in functions and client side right?
No compile time errors in any of them.,OK and need to add queue concept right?
Yes!,OK now I have done some modifications and it is getting compiled in online compiler so I will send you the file you check
It won't work in online compilers.,Yeah I understand
Have you made any changes to the code so far?,I fixed it and done modified so errors vanished now.
Really? I had no errors! What was the errors?,Little bit in while loop and switch case and functions
"Okay, but those are logic problems not compile time errors, right?",Yeah I think so
with no compile time errors.,"yeah fixed the decision statements,  loops,  switch case"
Test it with chatgpt.,You have commented some lines and fixed it and wrote the right ones in place of it
Okay.,"I will send you now,  if you are free check it and I will also try with chatgpt"
"I can't, I'm working with maths.",I will test it
Please do.,OK then
Apart from the last which is obvious without server running client can't connect everything else is because of no validations.,Yeah
Didn't understand what you meant.,Operatonn
An issue is there or not?,Operations
"Good, but I still didn't get that part. <This message was edited>","Like sending, displaying, login signup"
It's working fine right?,Yeah
We don't have any time for that project anymore.,HAHA 😅
Okay.,Monday is the submission date right 10th
Okay. If finished we can show early. I doubt any one else have done the project.,Yeah vikram showed me his project
for DSA?,"He incorporated html, css into it"
He was asking that for C that day. Maybe he will show the same to all.,"if we click bubble sort, it will sort using like a graph"
Oh!,Oh ok
I think I need to get 20 from the tests. <This message was edited>,Yeah >= 20
Hmm.,I think practice 5 b also
It covers till 5.a.,OK nice then
I tried but I'm not getting it.,Which one it is
"And solved the 2.a problem too, I think it's from function. No idea about the topic.",OK anyway these topics are enough
Prove the following logical equivalences without using truth table: i. [pvqv(~p^~q ^ r)]<=>(pvqvr) ii. [(~pv~q)-> (p^q^r)]<=>(p^q),Oh that's tough
Okay.,Tough
Okay.,OK bro do well. Answer the known questions accurately that's enough
"Will do, thank you.",They maybe there
Okay then.,He was asking us to apply for vtu if we haven't
what is that?,OK
And have to request C ma'am for lab tests. After 2.,OK
Is that different from what you did on Friday?,No no same
Are you saying we can apply through VTU? for USN registration?,No bro
Instead of Lab instructors?,No bro
Then?,"They will only apply,  they were asking us to go to them(lab instructors) after lab and apply"
Am I missing anything?,Still they haven't done
Oakie.,USN need to be applied in VTU portal and for that those lab instructors will apply for us. We need to go to them with our documents and lab instructors will apply for us
Okay 👍🏻,Haha
"Okay, I am going off. I will start on the project from tomorrow.",Yeah
if there is nothing else.,OK bro
Got my usn generated.,Nice
<Media omitted>,<Media omitted>
Really?,Yeah
Try giving bigger inputs.,ok let me try
I still have the headache so I can't check now.,Oh bro today I got fucked up by asking chatgpt and modifying the code
In the morning I'm preparing for DSA then i will check then if you still don't get it.,But nothing is happening
Why what happened?,Ok
Did you give the files to chatgpt?,"I gave the code to chatgpt to solve the error, but it didn't"
Keep track of what is working and what is giving trouble.,The code you have sent is as it is.
"No worries, I will check from my side.",ok
Take a break from it.,"Ok bro.  I think in linux system it will work fine, here in windows there is some input reading issue"
Are you bringing the tomorrow? Laptop?,Maybe tomorrow
Okay.,ok
Install the 32 bit version of the virtual box and bring.,Ok tomorrow we have C tests upto 9 programs
Try as in?,"Still I didn't write record, observation anything"
GCD is the last one. You guys did more than that?,"Yeah it hangs now, as it got white screen in it. I said you about that today.  So, I have to write record and prepare for tests"
Write it 👍🏻 If no other issues then we can install in class only.,Yeah ok
Yeah even we too. GCD is the last one. Matrix multiplication Fahrenheit to celcius Factorial and GCD,OK I will bring tomorrow But let's install virtual box in class only.
Okay.,OK
You know about leviathan?,OK
It's a beast mentioned in the Bible.,Yeah right
Beasts are considered unholy and satan in Christianity. It's one of the seven beasts.,Oh OK understood
I don't believe religious books'references should be taken seriously. It could be real or maybe not. But it serves as a lesson.,Yeah right
Allegories are written all over the bible. All of them speak something that different individuals will understand differently.,Oh OK
They are interesting as well as scary.,"No bro, I am seeing this reel from morning like 7-8 times"
You may or may not have seen it on reels - lucifer. He is one of the 7 beasts.,So I asked you
Okay 👍🏻,No bro I haven't
Okay.,OK I will try to see
You might have seen angles on paintings but you don't know how higher angels are described in the Bible. It's also very scary.,Oh OK it sounds interesting
Okay,OK bro I will see this
So most of the Christians don't know about it.,Ok
for DSA record how many programs we have to write? I mean Ma'am haven't told to write the 4th write right?,Don't know bro I was absent for the previous lab
Okay,Write until quick sort to be in a safer side
"if you have written the output for 3rd program, can you send me the pics?",Yes
👍🏻,OK
https://youtube.com/shorts/iLq2nyv3I5c?si=etSuNsOX6lP-HY7E,Hi bro
Class starts at 11 right?,Yeah bro
"We don't have breaks to do, when can we test? And still I haven't tested yet.",Anyway you tested in your pc right
Why rush let's check with it first today and then we show next week.,Yeah Monday is submission date 10th
Right 👍🏻 we can show then.,Haa OK bro
Then are you coming after that?,Yeah.
Ok then let me know.,OK bro I will text if I catch the train at 9
Ok,Check with these bro
Our chat has 3 right,Haven't modified server code
Okay,And header file remains the same
What format this file is,I think no need of changing code in server for validations
Okay,Yeah that's why I didn't sent that to you
Okay,Added validations in functions file and main file to check for validations
Okay,OK bro let me know if any errors arises <This message was edited>
Okay,Ok
Okay,Are you going to placement training?
Yes,OK bro If possible write my name in the attendance sheet.
Your sign?,Yeah
I will see,Ok
I'm not going to placement training,OK bro
Before 1,OK even I too
Okay.,OK bro
Okay,Ok
Will chat later,OK bro
What about queue?,Need to add
Okay,Ok bro
The queue is more important. So add that. We can see encryption later.,"As of now, Validations and encryption decryption is finished"
It has encryption too?,"Yeah wrote the encryption decryption loop, and I am calling that function  in every function"
Got it. On the client side right!,Yeah
Okay good.,"No bro, it has only validations"
I will be late. At this time the metro has a 10 minute interval in between.,👍🏻
Can the queue be added today itself?,"Sure, will complete within today"
You know adding queue right?,Ha ok bro then
Structures?,Yeah bro worked on it already
Okay.,Yeah we have used in our code before including sockets
I'm on the metro now. Another 20 mins max.,"to store the usernames, password"
For ip address and port.,Ok bro
So we have a break at 1 or 12:30? Confirm it.,"Ok, i think for ip and prt no only we may have used that, I mistook"
Yes for that only. I remember it.,Yeah
Confirmed?,It is there in the time table
Okay,Yeah bro in 3rd floor
Check the paradox section from the brochure. Looks fun.,OK bro
You want the doc?,Yeah send me if possible
<Media omitted>,Bro are you interested in this?
What about you?,Ok
Oh,Yeah
Okay,What about you bro? If interested you do participate
Let's see. As it's a 3 member event.,OK bro
Are you saying it's too far? Or not interested for now?,"Not the distance bro,  I am not interested as of now"
Oh okay. Then.,"No bro, my mind is not getting into it"
Okay got it 👍🏻,Yeah
Yes,OK bro
Same for this also. At my current skills I can't win.,Ha saw that now
Okay,Bro now I will incorporate queue and I will send you shortly
"Okay, I will test it then.",OK bro
What are we deleting?,No I have asked is the option required
I don't know how the dequeue works.,"Ok then I will not add dequeue operation, only enqueue will be added for Sending and storing the message"
Okay,"No, what I meant is in queue will have two operations right enqueue and dequeue.                                                                  Dequeue is for deletion part, so I have confirmed with you to  not add this part"
Okay I don't think we need that operation in our project as it has no use case.,Ok anyway I will not add this
Okay,Ok
Which structure are you talking about?,"Haha not structures concept,   like how the queue should work and where it need to be implemented"
Oh okay,Do we need to add a file to store the data permanently and queue as temporary storage
Yeah that was the design.,Ok
I was working on the tracker list.,Awesome bro
It can get complex.,Ok
Let me share it.,OK bro share in our group
"Yes, I plan to.",And test the chat files bro.
My sleeping cycle is ruined so from yesterday I'm trying to correct it 😅,"Errors may arise,  because I have written by my own like 90 % of the code for file, queue etc.now."
"Okay, I'm dropping off now, if there is nothing.",OK bro
I'm on my PC 😅,Oh OK 😀
Where are you?,Which room
In corridor,5th floor
"if you have the files before adding queue please send it, adding normal queue is easier than making changes. <This message was edited>","Anyway we are not using delete option. so, circular queue acts as ordinary queue"
"Cause I haven't worked on circular queue yet, So I don't know anything about the code part.",Yeah no problem in that. Circular is used because the message should be in a better way like the sequential order. I took help from the internet to select the best one for messaging And this type of queue goes well with that.
<Media omitted>,I think isValidname function and the mentioned is already declared so check once and remove it
code looks fine but still...,Oh
yes,Recently added functions weren't declared in that file
that .h is used only for accessing functions from client.c Are you calling any functions from main.c to client.c? other than what i called?,<Media omitted>
"You didn't add those functions, right?",Yeah the validation functions are called in the existing functions and they are not added in the  .h file
Okay,OK bro
testing.....,Ok <This message was edited>
wait,This is the code without queue.
It's running now although it has the same problem as previously I had.,What is that?
Your file naming convention.,Ok
changed to main.c,Oh shit
No space and no extra names.,"Yesss,  is that errors arised because of this. <This message was edited>"
be careful with naming conventions.,Yeah bro I am realizing it now
I always renamed files you sent and then compiled but today I forgot to do.,Haa OK bro
for future maintain version names for made changes.,OK bro I will definitely
Only one errors I encountered before that is ctype.h missing in client.c <This message was edited>,Haaa that is an header file missing
yes only that.,And rest of those
have the same issue as before. stuck in signup menu.,Uhhh
did you made changes to send message menu?,Yes bro what happened?
Cause I'm not finding it,Yeah the case 4
"there is no send message, I think. Please confirm it. If no, then I'm adding it. <This message was edited>",It should be there I think
I didn't find it so Im adding it.,Yeah bro
Just to be on a safer side go through the code once after I send it. Because we should what code is doing what suppose if ma'am asks.,OK send me after the completion
okay,👍
the entire sendMessage function has been removed from the client.c,No it's there yesterday also I worked on that.
in this one?,"Oh fuck I have added enqueumessage named function,  and I got some errors with it so I gave to chatgpt and it may have removed it. Please add it bro,  it's my mistake"
No worries I have added. Now testing.....,Nice bro
there is logic issue in login. I'm working on it,OK
So many logic problems.,OK bro
"I hope it's get completed tomorrow. We need a working project. The issue is probably with file operations, something not working correctly.",OK
"Well, that's partially true. Because it has logic issues.",Yeah I understand
Let's see what happens.,"It's OK , if it runs successfully then everything will be fine"
"I had to go line by line, debugging.","Yeah correct,  yesterday I had send message part and when I gave it to it, it removed."
"Okay, then. Nothing else. i'm dropping off.",Yeah bye
Bye,"Hi bro, is the project running?"
working on the logic,Ok
"I have found out the remaining issues, working on that. Hopefully no more issues arise in the future.",OK bro
which one you are working?,Chat
I'm working on the send message issue. It's not storing correctly on the server.,Same issue arised for me before
Be Specific. I have worked on a lot. So that if you are working on the issue which might be solved then you can skip it.,Ok
"Anyway, I feel it's going to work fine as I have understood the problem.",OK bro nice then
"We may have to ask an extra day from ma'am, I need to explain the big problem that I mentioned. Also need to have a queue in it. What do you think?","It is temporarily storing the data like messages,  once the user logs out the data will be stored in the file."
Let's discuss tomorrow.,Ok
Can you bring your laptop tomorrow?,"OK bro,  but if we put accurate code also,  the editor will show error"
I want to clear certain things and explain it to you.,Because of the syntax we use in visual studio 2022
No need to run. <This message was edited>,"That's why I couldn't run,  when I was working"
"I think there was a misunderstanding between us about the working of the project. So it has changed heavily. So even if I send the code you won't understand why I have made the changes. So don't go through the code by yourself, I will explain it tomorrow during break.",OK
"The initial plan was different and we both worked on it. Later I continued the code with socket programming. So I had the idea of what has been and what needs to be done. I should have cleared things that need to be done with you. Due to this misunderstanding the project structure has been changed. So we should probably discuss it, about the working flow. And also the changes I have made.",Yeah OK bro
If we want to we code today itself but that would not clear things between us. You need to know what our project is doing right? Just by going through the code you won't get it. So we need to be clear of the code before showing it to ma'am.,<Media omitted>
Don't worry about that. I just want to explain the code.,OK ignore that message.
Leave the stuff for now. Don't go through it. I will explain it all Tomorrow. Going through the code will only make you stressed out. A day is enough for us to finish the project.,Ok
So everything is clear now?,"Yeah,  went out and came back"
Okay 👍🏻,OK bro
We need to plan correctly for P2P to avoid these things again.,Yeah right
"I don't know, how we can do that, yet. As P2P is way bigger than this project.",We work on different parts and while merging everything goes out of our hand
Exactly.,Yeah
I have worked under a manager or seniors so I don't know how to manage this problem.,Yeah oh OK.
I need to learn about how to manage it.,Yeah
What about Linux? Without it you can't test code.,"If it is a full stack project then each individual will work on different parts like the frontend and back-end kinda and it would be easier to merge.   But ours is a complex one,  so we need more man power on working on back-end. Let's overcome that."
It should be easier for our project only if we knew how to manage it.,Okayy
Yes saw the timetable,Hectic
Can't do anything 🥲,Tomorrow we don't have DS class . So we may get one more day time.
Lab?,No bro
C retest.,Oh you were absent
Yes,Yeah
Haha yes in the group.,Ok
We haven't even executed those programs.,"Oh bro,  we have to execute in our own system and write test."
For C also?,Yeah only C
Didn't the web need to be done like that?,"No web test tomorrow. We have to execute 6,7,8"
Okay,No they haven't informed anything like that
Okay,Ok
<Media omitted>,I am getting my laptop
OKAY,Oh nice queue added?
https://www.linkedin.com/in/vignesh-b-213a84205?utm_source=share&utm_campaign=share_via&utm_content=profile&utm_medium=android_app,Hi bro. Issues fixed?
queue completed (not tested). Working on display message now!,OK bro nice
I think it would be better if you test for queue.,Like?
Leave that to me.,Because I don't have a compiler to run.
Have you tried running the code which I gave this morning?,No
Try compiling it.,OK
It might work.,My compiler will not work for this bro. I have to make lots of changes to run in my windows visual studio version.
Install gcc. Anyway you need a compiler to run programs in future.,Ok
download here.,Ok
ping me if any issues while installing.........,"OK bro I am taking laptop from my brother ,as he took just few hours ago."
Okay,OK
It's okay no problem. But don't you forget to install it as you need to for P2P project also.,OK bro I will do
"So, if I send the completed code, you won't be able to see. <This message was edited>",I can't run it.
tomorrow.,"Send me the code, I will understand no worries"
I will send. But I doubt you will understand the flow completely.,Anyway I have worked on it previously.. So no worries.
"your best option is testing it in the labs, tomorrow and see for yourselves.",OK then
I strongly advice this. You need to see how the project looks. A new pair of eyes is always good.,OK bro. Let's go through it tomorrow in lab.
"I coded till now, but displaying only the messages by or to the logged user didn't work. So, I have set default to display all messages. And I have commented a lot of stuff, don't remove it. I have kept for future references. If we suppose either you or I work on it again, then we can use those by debugging. That's it, we are not going to work on this project anymore, this is it. <This message was edited>",Slept early
Are you bringing your laptop?,No bro.
Ok let's see.,"If needed, we can adjust with Varun 's laptop"
We have to set it and show it to ma'am. <This message was edited>,Yeah
Hmm.,Ok
"Have you written the description for the linked list, merge and quick sort? In record.",Update code?
The final changes.,Yeah to run in windows I have done
"Bring your laptop today, we will see what's the issue.","OK,"
Ma'am hasn't said anything for us. If ma'am gives a test on merge and quick sort I can't write. I haven't practiced on it. So I'm thinking about skipping.,<Media omitted>
Do you?,Don't know bro
You guys have done the sorts?,No bro
Okay,Sorry bro I was in hurry getting ready and catching bus
Oh okay,For ghosting
any updates?,<Media omitted>
You didn't get to login?,"Logged in and after this,  it happened"
"Okay, I can see you have logged in.",Yeah
ctrl + c,Ok
use this command.,Yeah
or just logged in?,"OK,  it is asking me to enter pwd"
enter,Just 5-10 mins ago
OMG. You should have messaged me then.,<Media omitted>
is it updating?,No
try install instead of get.,<Media omitted>
worked?,<Media omitted>
"once completed type this ""sudo apt upgrade""",<Media omitted>
update will faster but upgrade will be faster,Shall I do now
you got the command prompt?,<Media omitted>
"yes, that is the command prompt. Do it.",Ok
y,Right
just 645 mb means you already got the latest applications. So it will update faster with good internet connection.,Ok
yes,OK
let it happen,OK
"Then I will give you the commands, so I need to see the location and names of the file. For the command to run without problems.",Ok
<Media omitted>,Why?
"We put so much time, now it's running.",Just made a 2 line change
what it is?,Initially the intwinsock function in main functtion
Why didn't it throw compile errors?,Don't know bro
Only God knows why.,😂
what do you mean?,Let's run server and two clients one is you and other one is me
How will we connect?,Call?
with our IP address?,I don't have idea
okay,<Media omitted>
"where is the queue thing, before the sending the message part?",Oh yeah that is not displaying
yes yes,Let me check
check the code,Ok
🤦🏻,OK bro
it needs rebooting after a upgrade,<Media omitted>
But why?,?
The more and more I'm starting to hate the windows. It's giving me heart attacks now and then.,Haha 😂
"Complete the linux procedure, I don't have trust on VS.",Shall I press ok
for that only <This message was edited>,<Media omitted>
select all and give ok,<Media omitted>
do the thing I said.,Which one?
this one.,What about installation then? Is it finished
yes,Ok
done?,Yeah done
type ip addr on linux machine and send me the pic.,<Media omitted>
Open cmd on windows machine and type this - ssh C:\chat\*.c veenit@192.168.133.135:~/chat/ (enter your account password of linux machine) ssh C:\chat\*.h veenit@192.168.133.135:~/chat/ (again password),<Media omitted>
"you have given ""Chat"" while creating. Be careful with naming conventions, don't user uppercase  do this -  mv Chat chat",Ok
do this,<Media omitted>
worked?,Yeah done now
copy the commands to avoid any kind of mistakes,<Media omitted>
why is taking extra slashes.,<Media omitted>
"I get it, it's because even in the windows it's 'Chat' try this now. Open cmd on windows machine and type this - scp C:\Chat\*.c veenit@192.168.133.135:~/chat/ (enter your account password of linux machine) scp C:\Chat\*.h veenit@192.168.133.135:~/chat/ (again password) <This message was edited>",<Media omitted>
my miss,<Media omitted>
ssh is used for logging and scp to copy 😅,<Media omitted>
done?,<Media omitted>
What? It's weird.,Yeah
type yes and enter it,Same issue
and try the same command again,Tried
then leave it,Ok
Will see tomorrow,I am too
bring your laptop tomorrow,If we run one client in Varun's laptop and another client in Linux OS. It will work fine right?
Yes as long it's on the same network it will work on any OS.,Ok
I'm going off then.,OK bro bye
bye,👋
If it runs with no problem then we can.,"OK bro. Because my brother will be leaving by 5:30, so I have to be in home before that to give laptop"
Ok,OK bro
send me if you have,"Just need to explain the tags used bro,  I left home just now."
oh okay.,Yeah I didn't carry record also
Okay. I will use chatgpt then.,OK bro
please share the screenshots of 4 and 5,<Media omitted>
This message was deleted,Hi bro
Hi,"If you are buying yellow books tomorrow,  buy one for me also, because tomorrow I won't be coming"
How many?,"Just one or two,  after the first test,  I will buy the rest."
I think you said we need to write in the old yellow books only right? Then why buying?,Need to confirm with the teachers bro.
Okay then 2?,Anyway tomorrow HOD will give instructions right.
"Okay I will, message me tomorrow also.",OK bro
"No they didn't talk about it. It was overall our mca degree. Like exams, assignments, seminars and projects. And how to write exams and externals like that. And did a little bit of data structure.",OK bro
Ok,Anything important in today's class bro?
Completed module 4 - dsa,OK. Oh then you guys will be leaving early today
Gave the algorithm for yesterday's problem and done Floyd's algorithm.,Ok
Still os class is there.,OK bro.
You gave it to anyone?,I don't think so
Then how?,Both my record and observation is not there
Yes,Yeah
Just woke up now.,Maths is fucking me up
Which one?,"Yesterday I have spent a whole day on maths, still couldn't complete the syllabus"
Oh,5th module
Oh you are going by module wise.,Yeah I am going through that only.
Till how many questions we have to prepare?,So I am going through that
<Media omitted>,Not this one
Okay,Yeah
Maths on Wednesday?,Yes
Other than maths which is more difficult?,Yeah bro
Alright,Mam sent some pdf right like module wise
So not from the assignment questions? But from the module we need to study?,No bro mam deleted the module wise questions
"Oh, then how?",We need to go through the full module then
No one has the doc?,Dont know
"I downloaded too, but once the sender deletes it's getting deleted in our devices too. If i had known before i would have forwarded.",Oh shit
WhatsApp sucks.,Yeah from this only
But why ma'am deleted?,Yeah even I don't know about that
Hmmm,<Media omitted>
Maybe i don't know.,OK bro
Years ago I watched. I was a fan of that director and watching his movies then saw the social network.,Oh nice
I have seen several movies of that director.,OK
Absolutely.,OK bro
"Shows the behind the scenes of making ""The facebook"". It was called The facebook back then.","Okayy, then I will be watching it today."
Okay,OK bro
For OS how many modules?,3 and 4 bro
Do you have documents like this for any other subjects?,Yes
Am I missing in any of the group?,Thimma Raj sent this bro
"Oh, Okay","No teachers are sending this, they should do send this."
Okay.,It would be very much useful for us
Right!,Yeah
Preparing Now.,Ok
thank you.,🥰
It would be help a lot.,Yeah
"I was going through the document, and found some questions were missing so went to the assignment doc, it has so many questions from module 3 and 4. Do we need to study all of it?",Yeah bro I can manage
"I thought it was less, now I saw it. I only know 4 🥶",Yeah bro we need to study all. But the PDF contains important solution in module 4
I would rather focus on the web. The OS is gone case.,Maybe
Is the web any easy?,Yeah it is easy only bro
Okay then.,Oh
And also the OS has the problems which were given in the previous tests?,Leave those.
Oh,You know page replacement algorithms and bankers right?
I know page replacement.,Yeah bro. No need to worry. I will send you the question numbers.
Thank you. I owe you one.,https://youtube.com/watch?v=2V2FfP_olaA&si=VLmPiXyjnpn4PSgf
OKAY,And problems aldo
okay,OK bro
"Oh, if you are searching now and sending then you don't need to. It would be difficult for you to search and send each one.",<Media omitted>
"Okay then, alright.",This diagram is imp
okay.,<Media omitted>
okay,<Media omitted>
okay,"These are important from module 4, the PDF I have sent contains important ones"
Okay.,"No,  these are just problems."
oh,Deadlock concept is important.
i know deadlock,Resource allocation graph and wait for graph is imp
i know that one too,O Lo
don't know,Watch this video
Will do.,OK bro
okay,"Yeah that's it, only deadlock is there in module 4"
"if you have done, can you tell me the answers for 20 and 21 question? <This message was edited>",OK bro
You arrived at college?,No bro
Oh,OK bro
Paid exam fees?,Yes bro. But still documents not submitted to college. Let's give them tomorrow
How was the web tests?,Yes
Okay,Oh bro last question was okayish
"I attended bootstrap, angular js and node js 😅",OK bro nice
Left the dom in both.,Oh OK bro nice
"Anyway 20 is guaranteed, that's enough for me.",Ok
You mean you attended dom right?,Test starts at 10 right?
Yes,Yes
"I need to start, i will at 8.",OK
Which one to prefer for DSA? I mean ma'am sent a document which you also shared and then ma'am deleted it and shared 2 pics. So I'm confused about where to start?,Prepare the finally shared one
What happened?,Haha sorry bro I was doing upi in shop
"I'm getting confused just by seeing the questions, how many sorts are there 😧",Yeah even me too
Is it manageable like OS? Like any important topics? I don't think i can read and remember everything it's there in questions.,Yeah we can somehow solve problems but writing algorithm is tough
No programs are there in it.,"Dijkstra,  quick and merge"
Okay.,"Inorder,  post order like that"
Oh okay 👍🏻,OK bro
"3,4,5 right?",2
This one.,5? File operations have mam completed that
I don't remember. I just remember ma'am starting it.,Ok
Recursion and structure will be important.,Yeah
This can be covered in tomorrow's 2 hr break right?,Yeah
Okay then now we need to start on DSA.,Yes bro
Okay bye then,OK bro. Bye
Hi,Bro
yes,No bro. Refer notes
😣,Yeah algo is also there in notes
okay,Haha
"there is graph traversal, merge and quick sort, radix and address sort, dijkstra, heap sort and max min docs in the group. Is that enough?",Yeah enough
What about you?,"OK bro 😀, this subject is very vast"
😢,No I was saying for 3 questions we have to read so much like that
is that easy?,Oh no very slow
out of 24,Oh yeah
almost 50% then. That's a good speed.,Maybe
what about people like me will do then 🤐,You will manage bro
I'm not reading 100% any subject. Just trying to cross the line.,OK
Is warshall and floyd easy?,Warshall is easy as we solved in class
what we need to solve there?,Oh quick and Dijkstra is important
like what is the concept,That V kind of thing
"Yes, but what was the condition?",Oh no. Study the algorithms atleast
is it if 1 & 1 then it is 0 one?,<Media omitted>
Okay,Oh OK
"if yes, send me the answer.",No bro
right?,Mam has sent wrongly
even 22.b is not warshall?,No
okay,OK bro
This message was deleted,Yeah
Okay,Where are you bro?
You?,Reached college
Okay,OK bro
are you there?,Hi bro
it's not isomorphic right?,No
okay,2nd is isomorphic
they both are different questions?,"Sorry don't know about that,  I have not solved"
Okay,It is  a single question
"Yes I did and vertex coming different, so can we stop there and say it's not?",Yeah
Okay,OK bro
do you have any solved doc?,No bro. I haven't solved even one
"Oh, okay.",Gemini is giving nice answers than chatgpt
I will try it then.,Yeah I have experienced
will we get this in today's test?,Don't know bro. It depends on mam
Okay,Prepared  ?
Going through probability,OK bro
I'm stuck here,Oh bro I forgot let me see in notes
ok,e value will be 2.718
okay,Ok
I learnt the normal method - finding mean and variance and coin tossing one and now poisson.,OK
I didn't find the binominal and exponential.,More than enough
Any way to know which method to use when?,If it is defective like that use binomial
"Okay, means only two outcomes",If it is f(x) from to to limit use probability density function
which one is that? any hint with formula?,-infinity to Plus infinity
Okay,"You may have studied, but if i say the formula correctly you will remember"
the table with k's?,No
<Media omitted>,Yeah
ok,Yeah
number?,4
I will check it,Okay
i know bino and poisson now.,OK nice
can you tell me where is the exponential method in the notes? if possible?,Ok
leave it. I probably can't learn that now. I already remembered so many things in one night.😥,OK bro
Is your name on the Excel?,Yeah. 619
I can't find mine,621
Fuck saw now It was hidden 😅,OK 😀
what to do for project?,"Yeah, I asked the same to you in college"
Even if she gives the time till end of the semester we can't finish it.,Yeah
So leave P2P.,Then
It is a very good project.,OK
that we can do in 3 days.,I will search in internet bro
Simple Database using C,OK can we complete it within 3 days
it performs basic operations.,OK
"if basic we can, using file operations.",OK bro
"know about it and see, whether we can do it or not?",OK bro
but we may have to use array or linked list.,Ok
saw DB? I have some idea regarding it.,I was just seeing
We need to inform to ma'am tomorrow about project title change.,Ok
for my php project,"If you have used, you would have come through Key-value pairs"
I don't remember. Enlighten me.,Called dictionaries in python
I learnt just basics of python. So don't know or don't remember.,"If Key-name,  then Value - name of the person,  object anything like that"
like linked list nodes?,"Yeah but it stores address,  here it stores the information <This message was edited>"
what about it?,"Then we have to implement the operations we perform in  Sql like create,  delete,  update and more"
yes but i didn't understand the connection with key pairs?,I will explain you tomorrow
I meant is it for our project?,Bro this is how we store data in a Database like SQL
We are designing a simple database using file operations.,"I don't have our previous project code, otherwise I would have sent it"
I mean is it manageable to code in 3 days?,Maybe or maybe not
"I remember writing mysql statements like select. To view, search and insert to create.",No I meant we would have gotten a idea about how sql actually works. Anyway leave that
Yes.,Then in table we used to reserve the fields in Key - Value pairs
Yes.,Yeah OK this we can complete in a short span
"Yeah, this was my basic idea.",Ok
But if we need to build like a real-world database then we have to design with the features you are saying.,Yeah understood
As it needs DSA concepts to code.,OK
what and which VIVA? do you guys have viva in lab tests?,Yeah DSA
🤐,😀
because of Seema ma'am?,No bro she handles C lab
She is the main culprit. 🤣,Have you guys executed graph programs
We completed all.,Then next week you guys may have
or just lab tests?,"No just Viva, no tests"
For all of us.,Yeah even we have
She will be pissed by now.,How to connect in multiple machines
but it just one of the solutions not the complete solutions. As running on different machine requires tweaking in networks both in the machine as well as the wifi or internet distributing machine.,OK
I don't know how to do these things.,Ol
You don't have right?,Laptop right?
yes,I will bring on Saturday .
this sat?,Because my brother needs it tomorrow and day after tomorrow
Will ma'am be there on sat?,😂 don't know about that
We are already way passed on submission date. I'm worried cause I will get very low marks for DSA tests so if ma'am reduces for the project also then I might not get 25/50 to pass. <This message was edited>,OK let's ask Varun to get laptop. And I will try my best from my side also
Okay.,OK
bye,OK bro
The web,Hi bro
Oh okay,<Media omitted>
Thank you,Node JS server output is not there in manual also
You can inform me here only.,OK bro
Why is Whatsapp delaying sending messages? Is it happening to you also?,Yeah sometimes
It's irritating.,Yes
It's been happening since morning.,Oh I saw it now
22:00,Oh shit  then what about your attendance
Don't know what to do.,OK. I will try to write down implement based on the menu and I will inform you if possible within 10
Okay.,Oh
Ma'am did Krushkal problems today. Don't know if I called it correctly but you know.,Maybe she may take like doubt clearing sessions
Hmm hope so. Hod is going to cause me a headache again.,It will be similar like Dijkstra
Yes finding a short route. But no looping or cycle is allowed.,OKayy
Even DSA has it. Okay.,Yeah
Because we don't have time so you won't be able to code all just using C.,OK. Is that menu OK I have written. So that I can choose what I need to code
"For example creating a table - means you will create a file. So you can code that, no need for Linux. Like that you can see what you can do with ease.",Yeah
Our project is considerably very small now using Linux. That's why none of us will have to code more. So we all code very little. <This message was edited>,"Actually while creating a table and selecting a table, there is use of file operations"
Okay <This message was edited>,"And while listing all the files , we need file"
Right. We can use files everywhere.,"After selecting a file, then just writing the code for operations and there is no need of file operations after this."
You will be surprised to see how little you have to code.,"Because we need to apply operations in the table,  which is present inside the file right"
No actually. Each table is a file. So the table will not be inside the file.,Will the machine require Linux OS then
That's absolutely.,Oh we are creating seperatee files for separate tables.
"Cause we can't store different tables with different columns inside a single file. It will difficult to view, delete, sort like that.",Yeah understood
I will try something small today to show a demo. Then you both will know what I'm talking about.,Ok
"Check with the ma'am, if she gives permission, you can design it. <This message was edited>",OK bro
Okay no problem.,Ok
Haven't thought of it. Just let the admin create a table for now. Will think of columns later.,OK
And select?,I want to clear some things :- * Will only the admin will have the access to create table. * User can use the created table and can insert data into it and perform operations
Delete and drop is different?,Adding the data
Yes.,Yeah delete will delete the specificed data. Drop will delete the table
This is a table menu right? So show only the list of tables. To display data it should be inside the records menu. Which I will do.,OK then I will remove that insert function
And admin should have all operations on tables while users should only have - show table - select a table to work on,<Media omitted>
It's for me.,"Clear me,  at which menu I have to work on"
Follow this.,👍ok
It will have more operations.,Ok
Okay,OK bro
What's the progress?,Bro went to chickpet to buy shoes. I will update you shortly.
Please do as soon as possible. I have to add my code and test it.,OK bro
"I'm working on the web project, so i will be there some more minutes. If I'm not available then also okay, you can send the finished program.",OK bro
yes coding while watching.,OK Finally won against KKR
Hmm.,Oh nice.
I'm using my PC.,OK
This project looks interesting to me.,Oh nice
Sure,Ok
I will add mine tomorrow.,"Yeah because before deleting,  need to scan the present working directory of the tables and need to update in a separate table"
good 👍🏻,"test this. If any changes need to be done, ping me."
I will do tomorrow.,OK bro
yes you can.,OK.
Okay,OK bro
"I have merged all other things of both your code, only login is remaining. I'm adding now my code.",We can provide  two options one is user  and admin login. in the main menu (In starting of the application) <This message was edited>
It's there or need to add it?,"It's not there for normal user login, need to add"
Just the code part.,OK
I will finish in an hour or so.,Shall I put it on the Same admin file or separate one?
"The codes were well written, was very easy for me to understand and merge. 👍🏻",Oh nice
"put in a different file, so that normal users can't login using admin menu. Otherwise, we might need to logic for that. So it's better if it's another file. <This message was edited>",OK sure
I have already merged all.,Ok
"So, let's leave the admin and user login. Will keep only normal login.",Ok
Not added the login.,Nice
Have you completed maths assignments? Please share any doc regarding it.,OK
I also need to work on the web project.,Not even started
C for me.,"Maybe C,  need to confirm with mam"
Also need to make a report on C and DSA.,Yeah
Okay. No DSA right? There is also web.,No
As we are doing web project is assignment necessary? <This message was edited>,No I think
Okay.,Ok
It's Linux specific.,Someday Shashank said he have installed Ubuntu
In his PC or laptop?,Laptop
Confirm it?,Ok
Will you bring the laptop tomorrow?,Bro hard disk got corrupted
Then? any repair?,"While my brother using,  so we gave it to the service center"
Okay.,Don't worry we can show our DS project in Varun's laptop
Okay.,I have messaged Shashank
Okay.,He may have or else we can install it tomorrow
install? I didn't get it.,"I have called him,  he will get his laptop tomorrow"
Okay 👍🏻,OK bro
"For C internals 1-10 means 4-14, right? leaving the sample programs.",Yes bro right
okay,Ok
I took print outs for last 2 week before or at 8:00 in college.,Ok
Web?,I have to take web printouts
Okay. You have the doc? Outputs of updated programs?,Yeah
Okay.,OK bro
are you there?,Yeah bro
I haven't executed those in lab.,You deleted this message
what about the research methodology?,Oh shit
"me too, realised now.",Ok
<Media omitted>,Thanks bro
I have sticked the output so some parts are hidden.,Ok
with assignments also.,28th
Shall we combine and do it? help each other in assignments and exams?,Yeah OK bro
OMG - really 😟,Yes
it's 14+ hrs,"Yeah,  one of my friend from other college said we can skip and finish in a day"
I can see we can complete it and there is no tracker there so we can complete it fast.,Don't know about that
Okay,Can you send me that link
"Also about the screenshots you asked for,  I started my pc yesterday, and i got green screen issue 😞",Oh
Yes I was.,Bro please send the screenshots shots of the  output if possible
"DS ma'am took insertion sort, maths ma'am revised. Web ma'am took ppts. That's all. And also ubuntu is installed in Shashank's PC. So we show tomorrow if no problems.",Nice bro ok
Will check whether the pc' is working.,Just for reference
Ok,You deleted this message
Fuck it's gone again,OK I will try to download from internet if possible
Ok and I'm trying to resolve the problem.,Ok
You mean chatgpt right?,Chatgpt will not generate proper images right
Are you able to take images from anywhere else?,Or else let's run it tomorrow and we can take screenshot and we can paste
No i don't think there is anything like that.,I will ask Shashank to download mingw to run our DSA project
Feed the code and request only the outputs. And take screenshots.,Ok
He said he couldn't do it.,Oh ok
I have asked him to install gcc,OK
Yeah,Or else do we have time?
I have messaged him now to install,Ok
No we don't.,OK.
Let him install the gcc. Only that is remaining if it's done then we can run both the projects. <This message was edited>,OK bro
running server in a different account.,OK bro
shashank has installed the gcc it seems.,Nice
<Media omitted>,Ok
Okay.,Yeah got it
<Media omitted>,OK
Bro wait I will keep sending screenshots and adding info for references You don't need to confirm for all 😅,Shall I get the printouts now or shall we take in college ?
Your wish.,Ok
<Media omitted>,What to do?
Are the screenshots enough? Anything else is missing?,We can show after the classes also
No not yet.,Oh what was the problem?
"DSA is done, but C has errors.",Ok
No worries,Ok
I have asked him to change it.,Who?
Shashank,OK 👍
<Media omitted>,Ok
"I need to read for the tests for DSA, So i will stop for now.  I have debugged all the void related errors and changed the datatype of data also.",OK bro carry on
"As you can't run linux, you can debug on chatgpt only. Take help of Shashank if needed he has linux.",OK bro
C project working?,"Tables are creating,  but the data is not getting stored inside the table."
Any help fromchatgpt? <This message was edited>,Not tried yet.
Okay let me know later,<Media omitted>
"Okay, thank you.",Run it and see once <This message was edited>

It's working. Have minor issues but the project is showable now.,<Media omitted>
Oh then what about the tests then? you have on thursday right?,"OK,  shashank got this error"
Okay.,Don't know about that

Sorry I overslept. No I'm not in college. I woke up now.,OK bro
What to do now?,Oh shit
Alright.,Oh OK
What did you do today in the web lab?,It's OK
Okay.,Web
You had internals?,Yeah finished
If so i will write the DSA lab test at the time.,All the programs saved in the computer. So no need to worry if we don't get the output
Sure.,Ok
Any updates from today's college?,No bro
They are not taking attendance right?,Now we have class at 1
Okay,No
No math class from now on?,OK
Okay then.,OK bro
It's 14.,No 18
She gave yesterday. I counted it.,"To enter the marks,  I have entered in the front sheet"
"I had slightly written in pencil, the marks.",And other two 4 marks each
I think 3&4,"2 and 6 maybe,  I am not sure"
But still I have to write remedial tests on Friday.,OK
Oh okay. C ma'am came to class?,"No,  we went to her place to see our marks"
Oh okay.,OK bro
prepared for DSA lab test?,Oh not yet
Okay.,<Media omitted>
"I will do what I can. I will show on Friday. If she sees it, okay otherwise also okay.",Yeah even I am also thinking the same
I'm neither writing the assignments.,It shows weather of every place all over the world
"I will code now, will see if it completes, otherwise I will code tomorrow also.","Oh bro, write math and C"
Oh great.,API
If I have time. What about research methodology? <This message was edited>,Bro today I confirmed with Vivek
fuck for real?,He said like that
Who? sorry I'm bad with remembering names. <This message was edited>,Huffman
"So, no need to worry for now?",Ha 😂
"I need code for web, study for DSA lab test. Tomorrow study for DSA tests. So I don't know if i get time for writing assignments. 😔",Oh
marks.,No idea about that
Someone sent the doc regarding that I think.,"OK, I didn't see"
Have to see if I can handle it.,Oh nice
What are you thinking for holidays?,OK
Okay. It should help me then.,Need to finish Java course and wanna build a project based on java
I too need to do a project on Java for the next sem.,Yes correct
Okay.,I am planning to do within may
"We may have not achieved what we initially thought, but I'm happy with the projects we worked and completed.",Don't know bro. Let's see how it goes
Okay.,Me too. I was expecting more on p2p
"On chat too, remember the one-to-one chat, Web UI. We couldn't do but I'm still happy that we completed.",Yeah
I'm hoping change that in next sem.,Haha nice
"Okay then, if you think of any for java project. Tell me I want to learn Java too. I too don't have any idea on what project would be good with Java.",OK bro when I start I will definitely inform you
"I understood Merge, quick and Kruskal but no matter what I do but Dijkstra isn't going on to my mind.",I am designing the web project bro
From yesterday Dijkstra is giving problem.,I haven't seen any of those still
"Oh, okay.",I will finish in 20 mins and I will start
Okay.,OK bro
hardcoded login.,Yeah we can do
😅,Ok

regarding the web project.,I have to show in others laptop bro
I have done with the project.,Maybe Varun or Yogesh
For sure?,Title?
Cause I will also show it.,Need to confirm
Is there any possibility of showing on the lab PC's?,Ok
<Media omitted>,OK
Okay.,I have closed my old laptop bro
Oh we need to do a report also.,Yes
Are you done  with it?,No bro
How to do it? Do I need to ask with the chatgpt?,No
"If possible, send me yours after you are done, I will imitate that.","And paste in MS word,  write content according to the index <This message was edited>"
"If you could send a copy, I will ask chatgpt to change it.",I don't think I will do today. Coz I am getting fucked up with Dsa
Oh then we can show that on Friday?,I have sent you  C report right. Then just change the contents in that
Okay.,Yes
Okay.,Or else I will try to do today bro let's see
take your time.,Ok
Except for Dijkstra.,Oh OK bro
Hi,Hi bro

Okay.,OK let's be there in college at 9
okay.,OK bro
You have any DSA document/,Yeah bro
Did you write the DSA?,Yeah bro just now finished
It looks so big.,Yeah
30! Pages 😶,More than that
I'm satisfied with the project work we did. That's enough for me from DSA.,What to do
I will I haven't written.,Yeah that's true
"We worked so hard for the project, then why should I waste time and efforts on assignment. There will be no difference between us and those who wrote just assignments with no project. That's unfair.",I will be bringing my laptop tomorrow
Okay sure.,Yeah very true
So I'm not writing it. If ma'am wants then she can reduce my marks. <This message was edited>,OK
Yes,"If yes,  where these are getting stored?"
"I'm not sure but it might be message.txt, check code with this keyword",Ok
1st screen as one user and 2nd screen as second user?,Right
Good then 👍🏻,Ok

"It's just for 5 marks, so shall we stick to stick files.",In college?
Yes.,They may do
"Okay, let's see.",Let's ask her
Okay.,"She is an adamant,  if we make the report in stick file,  then she may ask to remove and do spiral"
"haha at least then we will have time. I don't have any problems in doing spiral binding, but the time is the issue that's why.",OK
No I woke up now.,OK
I'm not attending.,OK
"I have to make report yet, so I will come before 10, probably at 9:30.","Bro can you come at 9:10 or 9:15,  because if ma'am leaves early then we have to come tomorrow also"

The luck is going our side today completely.,Oh man!!!
Yes.,Just 10
Oh god that's so less. Sir didn't said anything? 😅,"Sir asked why you wrote like this,  he found out that I wrote it today in urgent ."
😆,"He just made fun,  such a cool guy gave full marks for assignment"
Okay 👍🏻,Yeah
Yes done.,OK bro
I never thought I would get 43 in maths. 🤣,OK I got 47 in math and 50 in C
"Okay, Only the OS is remaining for me to see.",Yeah
Lot of lefties in CSK.,I think the team is saving him for 14-17 overs
"So it's better if he doesn't, that's why Livingston bowled.",Yeah that's true
Let's hope the match will be over by then.,Yeah

"for programs I will handle it, but what about VIVA? What should I be focusing on?","External invigilators will ask more questions(like 60-80 %)  based on the program we have executed and the rest from the other theory concepts. Mostly the definitions and examples like that,  there is minimum chances of asking about the working  of the code."
"Oh okay, well put thank you.",Yeah 🥰bro
Prepared?,Oh oh no....
Okay.,Still I have four days
Yeah right..,Need to just brush up things
Yes.,Because we have already practiced and studied

"If I have time I work on that browser development. For now, I will focus more on my career and college's.",OK
"I will after exams are over, in holidays. With focusing Linux also. Planning to make a Linux based project in the holidays.","OK got it. Even I have searched about it,  but I found no use case in Linux"
"Yeah, I looked up in chatgpt. it's main used in software and web development not in Linux, because of sole major reason. It doesn't have pointers.",Yeah got to know about this thing.
pointers are necessary in the OS related.,Yeah you said on that day.
yeah just watched now... <This message was edited>,Ok
I'm planning to build automation project using Linux.,Nice idea
I have to learn Docker & Kubernetes along with Ansible with Jenkins.,"Just Linux or do you need  any other programming languages to help with,  I will be helping you"
"Linux administrator is not a high paying job, so I will try learn more skills to improve the chances of getting good job.",OK bro
"I know Ansible not Jenkins. Ansible, I came to know about during my Linux course while I was working. It's an important thing in Linux roles. It's used to automate things using playbooks.",OK
The project I will be working will be very simple as I know Linux. It may finish in a couple of days. Have to see ways to improve along the way.,Oh really
What about you? Any plans?,Oh OK bro
As I have to focus more on C++ I will do simple projects on Linux.,From tomorrow I will be resuming problem solving in leetcode and learning some new concepts in DSA
So have you decided between Web development vs Data Science?,No from tomorrow. Because I got some little bit of confidence that  I can pass all the subjects with some decent marks. So I will be not much concentrating on academics from now on. I will be focusing to learn the essentials for a good job
"Yes, any plans for career oriented?",Like about projects?
"Yes projects, skills....",Ok
"I did complete research today and decided what programming languages, Technolgies, skills and Linux project I should do aside from college. It will help you to do things with certain goal. Instead of uncertain future.","Will focus more on Java now. Like going in deep and development stuff like react,  mongo db."
Cause having one skill means low pay scale. <This message was edited>,I am planning to work on that project as I said earlier like the Summary provider based on the users previous search like keep their older data and analyzing with the keywords
I'm sharing this because of what I learn and saw in my company.,Yeah understood.
"Yeah, I remember that's a good one.",Oh really
"With a single skill you will get entry level job, even if you have BTech.",Yeah
"With many skills the chances are higher, in fact you can demand the PayScale.","Within 3rd sem I will be ready with Java,  web development and Data science If everything goes as I planned"
Find a partner first for your Java. With other's perspective things will be better. You will teach and learn.,Yeah we can negotiate.
Okay.,"Yeah that's true. Shashank is on C++, Vivek said he will be going through ML like that. If Varun wants to learn Java, it would be good"
"Varun can go to Java. C won't be necessary for him. So, java is the way for him, if he wants a job. As 2nd sem is the last we will be learning programming language before company starts rolling. Work with him and tell him to start during holidays only. Preparing early. Like we worked on chat project so early and learnt files and socket programming even before ma'am thought.",Yeah bro. I will ask him to start if he's interested
He will learn a lot from you.,Yeah bro I will ask him to start.
keep me in updated. I like to know other things about tech too.,Yeah bro.
"I will also show you my Linux projects, you will also learn from it.",OK  bro it will be helpful for us.
yes,Yeah
"I just checked, my exams on the 4th not the 2nd 🤦🏻 I looked for 24 and thought it was on Wednesday. But my number is 124. Which is on Friday. <This message was edited>",Oh OK bro
Yeah,Ok
I swear I have never seen this much faster before.,Oh crazy
yeah,Oh really that's nice.
"as it's light and faster it's used in servers, I need to know about this for my roles.",Oh nice
"It won't be having any UI also, like the one in your pc, called ubuntu server.",OK 👍
It comes containerization.,Ok
okay,OK bro
there is also a simple version of it with only 5mb.,Oh nice
"youtuber has installed UI, even with UI it uses only 300 mb.",Yeah crazy
Yeah.,Ok
"I always tell my brother, if i recommend something to watch, you will definitely enjoy it. 😜 I will say the same to you. 🤣 <This message was edited>",Yeah
Only now I'm focusing on studies. 😅,Oh nice
It was free internet from jio time. I used to watch movies daily.,OK
"And of course the series too. I do watch now, but very less compared to that time. Even when I was working i would seasons very quickly.","Oh really,"
While I was working.,Oh oh
"I watched Silicon Valley, couple years of back, I think. So, if you find anything interesting that we can do, let me know.",Yeah I will.
which project?,Yeah they have kept it as add on
While I was ethical hacking courses there were multiple tools to scrap data off the internet.,I was telling you on some day
okay.,Bro thought about an idea like if users give a lengthy note or some text in numerous pages. We can develop a tool to summarize those concepts using important keywords and can give the users a short note or summary about their long conversations or info they dropped in our application
If you mean chat? I won't be working on it anymore. sorry I think I didn't say correctly. I meant if there were some techs from the series that we can work as a new project. I don't plan to work again chat or db one.,"No chat,  no db"
we need to develop AI for that. Won't that be a difficult? I don't know about just asking.,We can use an Open sourced API that's enough.
then?,"It will be the user's go to app that simplifies and provides optimal solution based on their input. Even here we use compression,  here it works by reducing the content into important points."
wait i wanted to share something with you.,"Our application stores the users previously searched data and will provide solutions based on the previous searches. So,  users may love using this."
"https://youtu.be/rS9CbsohFGk?si=ACU4ywq39YpBrs-E  check all projects. But I wanted to show you the 4th - camera project. As you interest in AI, this project looks good for you.",Where an AI tool just can't provide solutions purely based on the previous search. Sometimes it says I don't have access to the previous search like that
"I thought of doing similar like that in my final sem, detecting things like that, but resources were less back then. Nevertheless, if you are into AI, that's a good one to look into. <This message was edited>",Sure. I will be getting the prerequisites and requirements on the table soon.
Okay.,OK bro.
"Max I can contribute by C only, for now. If you need more, you need to add more members. If the project is big.",C++ will be fine for NLP
Okay.,Anyway you will be learning it in the coming days right?
Let me know about it.,OK soon
Cause I got more for you.,Nice
"What it does is, every time I talk about related to project or career it checks from the memory and uses that info before processing and provide me the desired result like you said.",80% of what I explained about the project has the same usecase as this feature. we are giving enormous amount of space to store the users queries and if the memory gets full we can back up the queries and the next time we can still provide data based on the previous search
"I don't think space issue with chatgpt, they have limited it to lesser the load on AI. With our extra space, the user input will be added with data from the database it will force the AI to give the result.",Yeah valid point
Adding more makes our project different and better than their.,Yeah that's true
I'm worried because it needs machine learning. And I have zero knowledge on it.,"Yeah we need to learn more,  but this will be interesting"
really? Are you planning to do in 2nd sem or later?,Yeah NLP NEEDS ML and math
Max I can design stuff or handling backend db like that. I don't think I can do machine learning stuff.,"Yeah. You can learn it,  see with Yogesh 's teaching you passed in math <This message was edited>"
But I already have huge number of things to learn for my careers. I can't give time for machine learning. It won't be useful also for me considering my career.,Yeah that's true
I will handle those only.,You can go with back-end db
Okay sure.,😂got it 😂
"Inform me what I should do and what I should be learning, beforehand. So that I can prepare.","OK bro. Gimme some time , before the exam ends I will be discussing with the technologies we will be working on."
okay sure.,Or else within next Monday we will decide
okay sure.,OK bro
"That ma'am from your DSA lab has not lowered my marks for lab internals 1 but also reduced in my records. Is she crazy? I'm checking now. She reduced 1 marks for each of the last programs and gave me an average of 9 in the index. Just because I didn't answer Viva she has done reduced in so many ways? I have attended all DSA labs, never absent till the last week, and that also I equalled by attending thrusday and they return it by reducing my marks. Fuck i hate it when I don't get marks for the work i done.",What the heck... Shitty people.
You watched the video?,"Broo.... I was away from my phone today, coz of some sort of reasons. <This message was edited>"
Please watch it later. It's for your sake. You are interested in AI.,OK bro I will within today
If you forget then you can star or pin it.,"OK,  after having food I will definitely see it"
Okay.,Ok
Leave that. How is the project? Intersting?,Yeah
If you are interested in that project you can research about it.,OK
https://youtu.be/KGfvunzq0a0?si=dutp1sQo3cPnup8n  Not for a project just for you to know how big Linux is.,Not that interested
Okay.,OK I will see it.
Going through the 2nd one.,OK bro
"https://youtu.be/qXUl3VsbA6o?si=phOT6jnRjTtrUHhj  Also this one, some of them could help you for web development.","Oh nice,  I will definitely go through it now."
Okay.,Ok
No i have your sent doc. Scanned one not digital. <This message was edited>,OK k
Preparation complete?,Need to prepare for viva bro
It will help me to work early and finish early.,OK
Okay.,Sure I will ASAP
Okay.,Yeah right
"I'm learning from the record then type it and check with chatgpt for any errors, like that. So I am not depending on any docs, if that's what you asked.",OK
Do we need to write those?,Tracing
I'm just preparing for the code and for VIVA.,Only for quick and merge sort
"Okay, I still haven't gone to that yet.",OK
you got the doc?,Sort right?
I found in the group,Just now I got
for how many marks tomorrow exams are for/,No idea bro
"No, only sort",OK bro
I'm at quick sort now.,OK
"When I prepared for lab internals, i didn't get what's happening in the program, I remembered the program without knowing, Kruskal was better.",Yeaa
I think Dijkstra and Linked List may cause some problems. Other are easy.,Yeah
"Linked List is understandable but it's way too long, even if we try to debug it will take time.",Yeah right
"But I'm really thankful to ma'am, most of concepts are well through to me.  So it didn't cause any trouble understanding.",Ha nice
"For queue, will get viva for others queues also?",I didn't get it
Will get viva questions for other queue types also?,Maybe they me ask because krushkal and Dijkstra are based in trees and graphs
Yes,"Nope but the concept used tress like vertices,  edges,  spanning tree"
Okay then.,They are used
At college?,"Left bus,  coming in 2 mins"
Okay,You?  Bro
Where you at?,In 5th floor
To study?,Let's sit here and study
Okay,Hi  bro
Hi,"Are you ok with Mongo DB, because you will handle complete database operations."
Let me check once about it,Sure.
Is it easy to learn? I mean faster?,"If you are good at SQL, then it will be much easier"
Is the basics of it is enough for the project?,Maybe
I checked about it. If the basics are needed then I'm on.,"OK, it will be little bit similar as of my knowledge as I have used MongoDB for a short period."
Okay,"Not sure, because we handle huge number of data like the Summaries and User queries."
"It's different, similar to json",Ok
Have you completed with the prerequisites for the project? We can make then how much we need. Just ask with chatgpt to prerequisites for all techs used in it.,"I am creating a word document, I am not using Chatgpt. I am going with Leetcode summaries, because we can get real world applications for specific usage of tech stack."
If you are done then share it with me. I will see. But for real we need prerequisites before working on the project. Otherwise it will keep on going.,"I am listing out the tech stacks, and creating workflow of our project."
It's ideal as that's how done in companies also.,And analyzing how the algorithms should be designed.
I got that all. But even before that we need to know what all things we need to know or learn. What you are doing comes later.,Yeah I am listing out. <This message was edited>
Alright.,"I understand, I have already made it and I am sending you in few minutes."
Okay.,<Media omitted>
okay.,Ok.
Who knows the frontend?,Yeah we need to face many complexities.
Let's see what happens. For the time I will go through MongoDB,"Haha, we can figure it out."
"For this frontend is necessary, how we can know it's working? Like the chat application we tested in terminal, can we do this project also like that for testing? without front end or front end is needed from the start.",Yeah we can !
As in we can test in the terminal?,"Yeah, when we use IntelliJ or eclipse or even Netbeans we have the feature."
alright,Yeah
okay,"Now, we are using Database and integrating API."
okay,Let me check and I will inform you.
they can?,"Varun siad he needs to learns React, DB and more."
Okay.,"If yes, then we can give frontend if he's interested"
"But first tell them your project, if they are interested, they have to learn it. There is no question of whether they will learn or not. If they like they need to learn.","HTML, CSS,JS can't handle this API integration and need to send request through API.  It gets very difficult by using HTML, CSS, JS"
okay.,"Yeah, that's right.  Lets discuss with them about the project"
"Tell them to all, whoever is interested can join. It's better that way.",Yeah.
Really?,"Like you said the algorithm complexities, so an addition would help you with this."
"build a team fast then, lead the project. only you know the project, so you know how many are needed.","Ok, shall we both pitch them on the exam day i.e, monday."
I could if I knew the project.,Ok bro.
"I'm okay that's why I said I will learn, But i won't lead this project due to lack of knowledge on it. I will focus on my side.",Ok bro got it
"The both projects we done, I lead that like researching about it, dividing the code and assigning who should do what. I knew for the DB that's why i recommended we use linux for finishing it quick. But this time you will lead it and assign our works and keep in update. Leading a project will gain you the leading experience. You cannot just add you have done this project but also add you lead this. I will be there if any help, but you have to lead from the front.","Sure bro, thanks for the words."
"No problem, completing the project is on your shoulders, so think quick add members fast and assign the tasks. The early we start is better.",Yeah right !.  Let's complete this talk within monday.
Sure.,Ok bro
"Alright, okay.",Ok
"HDD is priced at almost 6k, that's really weird.",OK I will
Even this is less than an HDD.,Yeah
Don't know why the price is similar. HDD has always been cheaper.,Ok
What's the purpose?,My cousin asked it.
Inform him.,Maybe for storage I think
Alright,Yeah ok
Rest of the things depend on you. Dividing the topics and giving them to team members and they can start doing that. I just wanted a head start to start early.,OK let's discuss tomorrow
Yes,OK
I will leave after 10 mins,OK bro
Are you in college?,Yes
Okay,Okay
just check the features. It's absolute beast.,Yeah. But this doesn't have snapdragon 8th gen processor
It doesn't. It uses 7. The latest processor never comes with a big battery.,Yeah
5000 was max 2 years back. Now 6000 max for snapdragon. Only iQOO has 6400 for snapdragon 8 gen 3.,Oh shit
"I meant the battery comparison vs 5000 mah. (That too it's so slim) The max brightness, gaming, video call, etc like that. Max they price it below 30,000. No one will give like this, leave that no one will come with ideas like this.",Yeah that's right
They even have phones with 8 gen 3 at just 28000,Yeah saw some
Those features blew my mind. It's a good phone.,Yeah
But don't have storage to update 😶,Oh OK
It has great features with AI,Ha OK
AI,"Oh really awesome,  we can include some of these in our project. Like the image,  auto text recommendation"
Do it. That's why I sent it to you.,"Yeah,  I am really excited to start the project. Let's start ASAP"
"Convince all. Like I said to Varun today. If it gets successful you can build a company with that product. This project you are doing is very big, take time and invest in technology and make it into a product.",We need a guy for front-end
"You should do complete research, means what a person should learn and do like that. A complete roadmap and convince others with that.",Yeah I will work on that
That project is like your child so you need to take care of it and let it grow.,"Yeah I am ready with the idea,  completed what and all we need like the tech needs.  We just need people now."
"Even if we don't get enough members, with full plan we can add members from other classes. But it's unlikely who would say no, for a big project like this.",Yeah bro yes yes
"But let's see in our class. Then we can go to other classes. We have our mentors, we can take their help.",Yeah
If you show full enthusiasm it will motivate others also.,Yeah that's right.
It can be a big thing in your life. Work hard on it.,Yeah. Instead of reaching out to separate individuals. What if we assemble all the people of our class and pitch our idea. So interested people will definitely join.
We can but we need something to show them. Because not everyone is our friends. So we need to show something. So I'm suggesting you work on this project for a long time. It can't be finished in a mere one or two months.,Yeah that too is right
We can add when we need.,Yeah definitely it will not because we get numerous ideas to implement
"Yes absolutely. None of us experienced in building or managing projects and people.  You know many businesses failed like this, by promoting early 😂",Yeah
I will help whatever I can with my experience and work.,Yeah bro need your expertise till the end.
Haha sure.,"Who the fuck this jitesh is, he is killing it"
My eyes are hurting because of lack of sleep but i can't sleep when the match is like this.,I haven't though score would go like this
I strongly believe today is RCB day. I think i  told you today. Let's see what happens.,Yeah
Jitesh is the owner of CSK.,<Media omitted>
He owns them.,How to store these chunks in different machines
This for?,Any idea
Connect with sockets and code to store them in different machines.,Not the cricketer jitesh right?
Write an algorithm to store based on some criteria to store them in different machines.,Yeah but our chat application didn't work in different machines.
Different machines as in different accounts or os's.,Yeah
To work on different machines we need to make changes to code. And in computers too.,OKayy...
For example - 213 chunks and we have 3 machines. So write logic like this - 213/3 = on each machines. This is P2P. Storing only one on one machine is not feasible.,"Yeah I understand, like I assumed an example of just 2 chunks in total."
"We actually need more. Suppose we have the same 213 and 6 machines. Then again we can store 213/3. But this time we store the 1st part on machine 1 & 2. 2nd one on machine 3 & 4. Like that. Then it will truly be a P2P. As losing on one machine, you can have backup on another one.","Got it,  how do we store them in differenr machines like how do we transfer those chunks"
"The more machines, we can make it more like P2P.",OK
Yeah that's how it works. We need more machines to make it a true P2P project. This is also a very big project.,These episodes were crazy
"Haha, more due to more connections 🤣",Hmm yes
Pandya won today. But our pandya 🤝,Yeah what a match
Yeah,Blessing bro really yes
Take fielded very well.,"Yeah,  others would have struggled with it"
My man throws bouncers and gets wickets 😳,"Haha our pandya,  he is bowling at 115-120 speed"
I wanted to say first only. But I didn't want to jinx it. It will be 10 vs 12. With Rohit on our side 😅 Hola even surya played for us 🤣,Yeah
Yeah,I lost hope in the 16-17th over bro <This message was edited>
Haha why? We have Bhuvi.,Pandya and tilak were hitting like crazy
I was very strong that RCB is going to win and change the record of last win 2015. Heck we did in tougher places in Chennai and Chepauk. We need to do it in our home ground also.,He got the game back
I didn't leave my hope.,Yeah I am waiting for that
🤣,"Last over was ultimate too,  but amazing fielding setup"
Yeah,OK bro we can sleep happily now.
Haha sure,We moved to second position in points table right? <This message was edited>
Should have won with more runs then we would have gone to 1st.,Yeah right!
saw the message?,What's that
electives.,I am thinking of Full stack development
But you need that for project right?,I can't understand how to write NLP algorithms
I thought you will choose AI,I am planning to choose it as a specialization in third semester
AI?,"Even I am too,  but I have to be thorough with development first."
alright,Ok
You know where we can find syllabus?,They may release later
"They have already given the code, so it's an existing subject probably",Oh OK
"from VTU, it not ours. But it might be similar",Yeah syllabus was nice
These electives are for B or Mtech or B.E students,Oh OK
https://elearning.vtu.ac.in/esk/P4/Syllabus/18CS52.pdf  got mine,Nice
first 2 modules looks very basic like ours now.,Existing ones
it has mongoDB,Yeah saw
good for you,Yeah
"It has P2P, hope we get that for real.",I can't find networking sub there
Didn't get you.,I cannot find the subject networking in the doc
got it now?,Nice saw the syllabus
alright.,What about maths?
exams?,Yeah
Need to start,Oh now
Yes,OK bro
"Sat now, saw the message",It look bit tough
"I want to pass, that's it.",OK
Are we supposed to select now?,I am thinking of going on AI/ML now
Okay sure.,Yeah even I thought like that in night
Someone who is focusing on that project should definitely get into AI,Yeah
Good,OK bro
Solved questions from 3 modules.,Yeah ok
I need to go through 5 module once.,"Oh... I saw CSK match it went well in the end by dhoni,  I thought they will win,  but bad luck"
"Haha, the afternoon match was also good.",OK
Could have won. But venkatesh iyer took a review for a wide and the momentum gone there. Afterwards it was silent and started losing wickets.,Oh OK
Same classroom?,I am in 618
Changed?,Don't know about the exam rooms
Okay,Where are you?
Left home,Oh OK bro
<Media omitted>,Bro why are we keep on losing the toss?
Virat pushed it in 2016 along with AB. That's it.,OK
But still no trophies. That's the value of having luck along with skills.,Point to agree!
I don't feel great from KL today. Let's see. Need Rajat very much against axar and kuldeep. He shouldn't get out against pace early. We need him against spin.,Yeah very much important.
Need Virat to finish at least today.,Yeah I saw faf's post on instagram today.
And Phil to open strong.,Yeah that's important
220+ must.,We can expect from Dev padikkal also
"It's a batting paradise, everyone can go at it. But we shouldn't lose more wickets like last time. Take time and hit. With more runs the pressure will be on the DC. With less runs, no pressure they can chase easily.",Yeah that's right.
Virat has good stats against DC.,MSD will be leading CSK from now on.
Haha. Then jadeja now ruturaj. I think ruturaj might leave CSK if has some respect. Unlike jadeja.  With dhoni there no one can take the captaincy. Absolute shameless. He is ruining his legacy.,Yeah that's 10000% true.
MI forced Rohit. But CSK can't.,"Hae bro. You sent AI android update right? I learnt how to implement it in our project today. It's super complicated,  but it's interesting"
"Not everyone is as good as Virat. Virat is a team man. Patidar's transition to captaincy was smooth, all thanks to Virat.",Need to go through some complex math again.
Good. I selected the electives in the form too. That subject is a must for my career. You also take what's important for your career.,"Definitely AI/ML , this is very exciting and complicated too."
Yes. That's what I thought.,Yeah our MAN
Alright.,Shall I reach out Shashank for front-end
What's his role?,He will handle Back-end and API
Backend as DB? I have taken that right?,Java
Alright,You will be handling complete DB. I will explain last day like what we wanna do and how the application and workflow will be.
Okay. MongoDB right? Or other?,Mongo DB bro. Locked
Okay then.,OK bro
"I was shocked that like C, assembly language is still in use today.",OK
It's so old. Even than C. But still in use. 😳,OK. Is it a programming language
Yes it is.,OK
"It will be small, very short in a line. But very big. Even for a simple program you need to write a lot of code.",Oh OK
For hello world 😅,Oh
"Difference is assembly language is low level language, while C, C++, python are high level languages.",Yeah understood
Yeah,Yes
Padikkal is struggling.,Yeah
Gone 😅,Fuck
Yes,Yeah
"We might, with tight bowling. Pitch is not the same. Need to wickets in powerplay. Depends on this.",Yeah
Tomorrow.,Yeah completely
*For average.,Yeah even I have to practice more DSA problems to pass the initial rounds in an interview and then about the tech stack and projects comes in further rounds.
DSA is important for sure guys.,Yeah very very much
That's how big it is.,Oh!
We won't. That's why I have less care for college things. All i want is a degree certificate and learn stuff from college which may help my roadmap.,Yeah that's right
Average that's how I scored throughout my education.,Even I will follow this
So I don't care if I get less marks in college. Getting a good job is more important for me.,Ok
That's the best way for me which worked.,OK
And will work. None of my interviews asked me how many marks I got.,Yeah right!
"As a matter of fact, if you have skills not even your degree matters.",Nice.
You will be shocked to know how less Americans study.,Yeah I am aware of that
Maximum study till high school only.,Sad truth.
Thank God Faf gone.,"Lost hope,  came out"
Want KL to go now.,"I am interested,  but I may not get time this 2nd semester,  so I may do on 3rd like AWS  certification"
"First ball went for dot. Suyash gave a look at Axar. Axar saw it and smiled after he Suyash turned. I was expecting a boundary next ball, and Suyash bowled a bad ball. I thought that was deliberate. Suyash was setting up. next ball also went for 2 runs, Next ball Suyash bowled, at place which Axar hit for a boundary. This time Axar lifted it and got out.",No bro
"Suyash is a genius, trapping the axar so well. Axar was so simple minded went against him when the pitch is not favouring.",Some heat in the game
Suyash just need some experience he could be our next Chahal. Under DK he will flourish well. He certainly got my attention.,Nice bro. Our spin is getting welk
yes,And this boy's mind game maybe good
He is. None of them noticed his gameplay.,Oh yes yes
Man I thought KL's vengeance against RCB was over but it ain't. 😶,Shit
Yeah! it's done and dusted.,I got some hope back. But it just went in air
"Ma'am sent this, but it looks so small.",I think it's enough
Alright,And go through the problems
Okay,<Media omitted>
Got ti.,OK bro
Have you watched dragon? Movie?,Yes bro.
Dragon or Vidaamuyarchi,Nice one
I want entertainment,Dragon would be good
Before exams,Me too
"Or Orion, wherever it's feasible and less expensive.",Ok
Wednesday?,OK sure
Before the web exam.,Thursday we have exams right
But we can manage the web.,Yeah
Can't go on the exam day.,What about After the exam day
"The price will be more, on weekdays.",On weekends or weekdays
Wednesday is best.,It will take me a whole day to travel and finish the film and going back
I will go agnyathavaasi after the exams.,OK bro
"Probably Wednesday, can't go Monday.",OK bro I will inform you if I am able to come
Sure.,"Oh OK,  then my day will be gone"
There is an 11:00 show also but it's not Atmos.,Ohk
"See if you can come, otherwise we can go any other day for another movie.",Yeahh
"I'm not going to c++ for now, so if you have anything to do in c++, tell me now. I will be focusing on python for now.",We will be generating a free API from Gemini and we will be importing in Java. That's it
Okay good.,OK bro
Alright. I want to know everything about it.,We will be using many APIs for different features
"For weather, do we need to request access to use the API?","For image, auto text completion and more"
All of them provided by Gemini AI?,No we have to use different APIs
Okay.,"Means,  you can generate a free API when u sign up for the first time"
Okay.,And if you want to generate more than you have to pay for that
"Oh, okay. Just for testing I need it.",First time it will be free and next time we need to pay
Alright.,"Not like that,  you can use an API for lifetime or some limited amount of time depends. If you want to generate another API for a different use then you have to pay"
How about for gemini AI? It's free right?,Yeah it will be free.
Okay.,OK bro.
Anything?,<Media omitted>
I don't know which are important questions. They all are basic for me. So i really don't know. What sir told me was about questions regarding file attributes which he did in class again and again. Other than that he also said they might ask for Unix commands.,OK 👍
I can't be of any help with it. Sir told only those 2 things.,Yeah ok
"Important : When asked file question from 9, answer from basic files, when asked from 10 answer from Unix file.",OK
"If you have doubts from the Unix, i can help it. Before exam.","Yeah that's what,  I am learning how to write code to call API,  how to connect using keywords and there are plenty in spring. So I am learning"
Okay.,Yeah I will
Tell me when I should start learning mongoDB?,You can start from now only bro. Like the basic syntax and how to store and segregate user data and their searches. And summaries and their  queries need to be stored in a separate file
Alright.,Yeah OK bro
Thinking about these will put pressure on us.,"Yeah,  but more exciting too."
"Remember what all the features we thought to include in our chat? One-to-one, web UI, security, etc. how many of it were we able to achieve it. It's exciting for sure. But it will mount pressure on us. So let's take it slow and steady. Build bit by bit.","BTW,  varun was asking about Networks (electives)"
Weird.,Yeah that's right!
I will check with him.,He was asking. So I said that you know the best about networks.
He took the full stack. It's better for him. Should choose networks if one wants to have anything to do with it.,OK. Yeah right
Like taking inputs and then sending requests and interacting with gemini AI?,"Yeah it does,  whenever there is a request seeking any sort of service.It does"
Alright. I'm interested in that. I want to know about it. Automation is important for me also.,OK bro
"If this is right, who handles what.",Yes
3 won't be enough. My opinion.,"If you need someone for DB, then another person will be added"
At least need 2 on each tech.,Yeah even I am thinking like that too.
"Varun is in between full stack and networks. If he takes networks. Give me Varun. We look after the backend, I'm thinking about automation as it's important for both of us. Not confirmed but have to see.",There is ain't much work on front-end.
Okay,"Options :-  Shashank, Rohit (as you said earlier),  Vikram."
Ya,Shashank is not familiar in react
Alright but still if someone knows it would be better. We can add them to other tasks,Yeah right.
Does a full stack subject has react?,Yeah then we have these 3 guys as options for front-end.
It would be easier then we can add anyone who takes up that,Full stack is the combination of both front-end and back-end
Anyhow they have to learn it,Yeah right. What about Vivek ?
The huffan guy?,It will be there for sure. And front-end engineer need to be creative too to implement things.
He knows react?,Don't know bro.
Okay,"But they will be in a group like Shashank,  Vikram and vivek and some people"
Tell them all whoever is interested can join. It's not just for the frontend we need right?,Yeah OK
"Have to start, will do tonight",Oh OK bro
"Owing other stadiums, meanwhile our stadium is owning us. 😭",Haha they will bounce back in the next game for sure.
If they can't win in homes then forget about playoffs. Chinnaswamy is a curse.,"Yeah true,  they will give a strong comeback for sure let's see"
"Next is Punjab, the team is full of salt like players.",Yeah saw their matches
"Yes, can win in their home but difficult in ours",Hmm
Anyway I stopped c++ and picked up python,OK that's nice.
Went through intro on mongoDB,Nice bro
For project?,When can we officially start our project
Java has inheritance like C++?,Yeah
I read somewhere it doesn't have like c++,Like the multi level inheritance is also supported in Java <This message was edited>
What about the interface?,"It will be there,  but I haven't gone through it still."
I have to learn Java too in the next sem 😶 Don't know how difficult it would be.,A bit difficult
Just to let you know along with your project I'm gonna work on another 2 projects too.,And python is also vast
I need python only for scripting not for programming,Nice bro. Your Linux ones?
One is Linux under that will do many projects another is based on the network's subject. Will do a network related project useful and related to my career.,OK bro nice
Haven't thought about what to do in the network yet. But I need python scripting for that. So learning that.,OK
"Not commands and also not code too as it doesn't come under coding but scripting. It's related to automation, but not complex like coding programs. <This message was edited>",OK any example on how to implement it
"#!/bin/bash  # Simple backup script  SOURCE=""$HOME/Documents"" DEST=""$HOME/Backup_$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S)""  echo ""Starting backup of $SOURCE to $DEST""  # Create the destination directory mkdir -p ""$DEST""  # Copy files cp -r ""$SOURCE/""* ""$DEST/""  echo ""Backup completed successfully!""","Bro placements are nearing, I am fucking scared because I have to practice DSA too parallely with the project"
It automates jobs for us. Which is a huge concept in our field of work.,OK
Yes. True DSA means till which concepts you have to learn?,OK nice
You are taking AI so you need time to be good at it.,Yeah bro. Even I am also thinking of going off campus and on campus too.
Anyway I don't trust on campus coming to college would give any good.,Yeah really yes
"So don't stress out. Focus on the project, it will yield you a good job.",We have to build our github and linked in profile really solid and need to do lots and lots of networking in linked in.
What's your ideal role?,Are you asking Like a job role I am willing to go
Yes,Previously I had full stack engineer role in my mind and after understanding it a bit. Now I want to move myself up with AI/ML Engineer <This message was edited>
keep one as main thing other as backup. If it's AI then focus on the project more.,AI/ML will be my main focus
Okay.,Very much important as I have researched about it. And understanding the ML algorithms is very much important
"So, you want DSA too, but you can't prepare for both before placement. Anyway, do you think placement is going to give you AI related job? So, focus on off campus, take time to prepare and then go for off campus. They both are huge, can't do in a small period of time.",College placements won't hire for AI roles for sure. I have to go off campus
Oh!,Yeah bro this is right
Same as always.,OK
How hard other 4 modules are?,"As we have studied before,  we can easily manage"
okay.,Yeah module wise is there
Let me check,OK
<Media omitted>,Yeah bro
Okay.,OK bro
I have a fever so I'm not sure if I'm going tomorrow for the movie.,Oh suddenly
Yeah,OK bro
"HOD said they will give permission for work during college, but don't know about internships.",In last semester we have to work for 3-6
Only in last?,"Oh nice. If we get internship,  we can go work with permission I think"
What do we have in 3rd sem along with electives?,Yeah this is main and we can work in other semesters too
I'm planning to start in 3rd sem.,Just the specializations and some projects maybe
"Only 3 subjects, why waste going to college for that.",I am planning start applying from 2nd semester mid
For internships?,"Yeah,  anyways we work in company projects right"
Alright.,OK
Which role will you apply for internships?,Will you apply on Linux specific or
So probably only till 2nd semester we do projects.,Both ML and development roles
Okay.,Yeah I got to know
Alright.,Yeah OK bro
Tomorrow will you assemble and talk about the project?,"OK,  which role you are planning to him?"
At that time i will speak with him.,OK. You both will work on MongoDB right
Yes.,"I got stuck with some spring concepts,  I am sucking at it."
Implementing what?,Spring concepts according to the project
I meant which part of the project?,Java back-end
Alright.,OK bro
Difficulty in coding or coming up with how to do it?,Still there are lot to learn from my side
Alright.,OK
😅,"Bro now, you and Varun will take care of DB and I will handle Java. Backend is set now. Now,  only front-end guy needed"
Yes,Only one guy is enough or do we need 2 ? <This message was edited>
Need one more for Java and AI too,<Media omitted>
Depends on that individual how much he knows.,OK
If you are okay I'm okay.,Because to develop an API we need ML. But we are using existing APIs
Okay,After developing the initial things. We can do that. As NLP is very difficult to understand and implement because of advanced math
Oh,Yeah I am exploring
Who will do that? Are you alone enough for that? When do you expect to finish with that?,I am planning to use Googls's text to speech API as it does the same thing
I want to know how to work with api so tell me about it when you do,Later when I start Ai/Ml I will understand and do those concepts
Okay,OK bro
Like a diagram or flow chart.,Yeah sure I will prepare and send by today
okay,<Media omitted>
I have doubts about the database design. I will confirm it with you tomorrow.,Yeah OK
I will say tomorrow. It will take time in chat.,OK 👍
https://youtube.com/shorts/xixOjDLNaP8?si=3pLkDaTfmKnA-5Yn,I have thought of incorporating the 3rd feature in the project like before 5 days. I never knew it's already there in market <This message was edited>
Let's talk today in college,OK
I saw it this morning,OK
He is talking about going to hometown. So he might not work early as possible.,OK
Didn't say no to me.,OK then
For both us and the system.,Yeah that will be a big headache then
Ok we will proceed with this.,Sure
"Think about it, it's going to be huge.",What if we create separate indices for the most searched keywords for a specific user
I didn't get it.,OK I will try to figure it out how to implement this.
"We need to identify certain keywords with unchangeable numbers. Suppose, If it's data type  - 5 If it's arrays - 8  Like a dictionary, and it searches for the number, and the number exists then it will take the keywords stored in that and perform operations.",We have to create a separate index for most searched keywords info in the user table and it will be easy for the DB to search the keyword from the specific userID
"And the dictionary should be automatically, if a keyword doesn't exist then it should update it and assign a number to it.",OK nice then.
It will still create an overhead problem.,"OK go with this,  it seems to be better"
Tell me if you understood?,Yeah understood
Okay.,But it should be user specific. The dictionary table will contain User IDs right ?
"No, it will get the number from the table and then searches for that number in main table using bubble sort. as the keywords numbers in the dictionary table will be in sorted order. So using bubble sort will reduce the performance problem on the main table. But the user id is not required in the table.",To match the keywords only with the specific user's previously searched keywords
It will match in the main table using user id.,OK nice
"We still haven't worked so we can't make a perfect plan yet. So don't worry, if changes are needed we will do it.",OK bro.
Still raining,Yeah
No rain here.,OK
Luck never favours RCB.,😂😂
Remember 2019,BTW Weather was not good
RCB performs well in rain games. That's something to cherish.,Yeah ! Have seen many
10 toss lost. Kohli showed his number of fingers in a funny way that he lost the toss.,Gayle and Virat in 15 and 16 over games were fire
"2017-19 worst years but 2019 was way bad. First 6 matches 0 wins. Then came mike Hesson in 2020, since then RCB has won more matches than anyone.  2017-19 nightmare for RCB fans 😭",Oh yes !
Hi,Hae bro
*with no practical knowledge or practice.,April 25th onwards would be fine
Project starting date?,Yeah bro
Okay,Because I have to cover my learning part still
"Not only you, Even I. and what about others? <This message was edited>","You will cover db,  then Vikram said he is familiar with react."
"Talk with them and plan it. Everyone should learn and be ready for the job. We can't wait for others to learn, because it will halt our project works.",Yeah
"So, only 4 members right?",Yeah enough
What about Shashank? Did he say no for the project or no for the tech?,"Vikram can have more learning time, because after the back-end completes, he can design front-end accordingly"
Got it.,He didn't say no for both
"If you think so, then okay.","Yeah,  when we start implementing ML algorithms into this project,  then we need other guys. So, then we can reach out to peoples. <This message was edited>"
Alright,OK bro
Probably no.,Ok
Chinnaswamy is worst for both RCB and RCBW,Yeah can agree with this
It's filled with unluck. No wonder we lost the easy final too.,Yeah 😔
But need it very soon.,"Yeah,  Shashank Singh is dangerous bro"
Pitch is not good for bating so need to play very conservative. So it will restrict him probably.,Yeah. Pitch is very bad.
"It's not a batting pitch this season, so the batting heavy RCB failed thrice. DK said even they are confused about the way the pitch is behaving.",Yeah maybe tomorrow. Previously it was
Only toss wins can save RCB. They should send swapnil singh for toss from now on 🤣,😂😂
You don't remember?,nope
"Swapnil singh is considered a lucky charm for RCB. During last wins last year, after he came RCB started winning.","Yeah,  you said to send him for toss"
<Media omitted>,"Hoff is creating pressure,  suyash is leaking runs"
"Wrong post i think. But you get the point, he is only the lucky I have seen in RCB for all these years 😷",Yeah got it bro
My pc is acting weird seeing in cricbuzz,OK
"Seeing from RCB batting, i think we needed an extra pace bowler.",Yeah I was thinking the same
Yeah,"They aren't losing wickets oftenly, so that would be a great plus for them"
"Anyway, we still have to bowl spin. 😑",Jinxed means?
Haha Google it,"Oh shit,  this wadhera is smashing"
"Suppose, if I don't want you to score full marks. I will jinx it by saying you will get full marks. But you end up not getting. So it's kind of a belief that saying something will result in the reverse.",Oh OK 😀
<Media omitted>,😂😂
Rajat looks so sad.,😒atleast he did add some runs. But match came to our hands in the tenth over
He deserves better.,Yeah even I thought the same.
Yeah,😔Shit
On the brighter side the next match is an away match. So we will win it.,Yeah.
Thanks.,😂
"17 years ago, IPL began on this day. RCB lost the match and Virat scored 1. It has happened again.",Hahaha 😂. If it works I am happy
yeah,OK bro
"It happened last year also, it took many days to repair it. It's happening again.","Oh shit,  OK bro"
I had planned so much to do. All in vain.,Oh ...
https://youtube.com/shorts/jo6U429l3JM?si=CW7Kzl7tNlrHIsYZ,Interesting
His channel is good. Check out some. He explains how real applications work.,OK bro
Told the repair guy that it's urgent. Let's see.,OK
College starts from June?,Oh no bro
Saw?,No
This one,She said campus placements will start from June
I don't believe that.,Me too
Too early for us.,Yes
Absolutely.,"They may provide internships,  that too unpaid"
I really don't care for their internship or work. We are on our own. I'm prepared for it.,I have started to write code for the project
"Even you should be. Getting AI related, is difficult from them. <This message was edited>","Starting like a baby,  need to work a lot more"
Great.,I am thinking to not attend as of now in first year
I'm worried about the dates now. That means our semester is going to end late.,"Yeah,  I am thinking of completing DSA and dev within June or July. From July I will start ML"
I want to work as soon as possible.,"It will finish soon bro,  don't worry about that"
I was expecting it to finish before Oct.,"Yeah, probably we need to go for internships"
Let's see.,2nd or 4th sem?
"I had a good plan and started but the pc gone. Ruined my plan, still i can prepare for the work within this year and appear for interviews.",It may end On October bro
No job preparation would or should take more than 6 months.,"OK,  but we shouldn't leave the flow bro (learning), let's work hard for the next 5-6 months"
"Yes. Earlier, I thought it would be on sept both exams and holidays and 3rd sem from oct. Then i can work.",Yeah
"I have a solid plan with daily time given, it's easy to prepare within 6 months. I'm confident about it.",Nice bro
So i was thinking of working on an internship from oct or work if i get it.,If you start from may can you complete your preparation within Oct
"Yes, I can.",Yeah I am planning to master ML within Oct or Nov and I will start applying from this September only
Good,"Nice bro. Do it,  we should crack an internship or work within this October or November"
Yes.,Yeah that's right
"Yes, it's compulsory for us.",OK!
I will let you know when I get the pc.,Sure bro.
Why spring boot?,He will teach about how to write sample Mongo DB code and skip the spring boot part
Let me see that.,"OK bro,  then skip this video,  it will interrupt your learning."
"Yes, it would be confusing.",Compass is for gui view of records
Got it.,Yeahy
"I will install it, once i get the pc.",OK nice
And we have to do research methodology 😔,Yeah
I don't like both of them 😔,"Ok,  but you have to pick one"
I know,"Don't concentrate more on this,  focus on yours like devops"
Let me meet the mentor once.,OK
I don't even have my PC now,We may have to finish that within the end of the course to get passed in all the semesters
Alright.,Ok
Any idea?,Don't know bro
Alright.,"OK,  what about Varun then"
Haven't talked with him.,OK
They have said that they can't appoint a faculty if the number is below 35.,Yeah.
"So I will ask for self study if it's possible. But I can't say for others also. Even if they allow it, how many others are ready to study on their own? Both things are highly unlikely.",Because different individuals have different interests
"Even in my degree, I had to study Hindi on my own. Later they assigned a lecturer.",Yeah right!
I won't stop now.,OK
If you do the research methodology let me know.,OK bro now I don't have time for that
"At that time, I will probably visit and give a letter to the HOD.",OK
"Let me know, when you do.",I have Started doing leetcode problems
For DSA?,Spending like 2-3 hrs a day
Okay.,On the other half I am doing the essentials for the project
Alright.,"For an easy problem,  I will take like 15-30 mins"
"Okay, cool.",Because I am learning a concept and solving problems on that
Learning a new concept and then you can code in that less time?,"Now,  I have to write some code and incorporate it"
"Alright, great.","No,  learning a concept takes more time. Now above mentioned is for just problems"
Okay.,"It's a free one,  anybody can generate"
Okay.,"For the first time no access required in both,  then if you wanna generate more api keys,  then we have to pay and can get access"
Got it. I still don't know many things about the API. Need to learn.,OK
Saw this?,<Media omitted>
Alright. I thought it would be useful to you.,Yeah even I thought like that
https://youtube.com/shorts/OiqJ4qye4tc?si=ZIHuwF97VPkbRPJa  Just imagine how much of DSA concepts used in that game to hold all of it.,"Yeah,  stunning!"
https://youtube.com/shorts/tqeIQE26iJw?si=j4DyfCDBEMgj1P-X,Oh nice
Yeah,Hi bro
My laptop?,Sorry PC
It will take time,OK
Okay,OK I will create a group tomorrow and will just put a reminder on the individual 's roles and I will start assigning tasks
Okay,OK bro
Yes,Yeah awesome match
Yeah,Hi bro.
"Nothing to work, doing nothing daily. I'm going mad 😔",Oh shit
It feels like hell.,Ok
What about others? Are they onboard?,Today i will create group
Alright. But I meant like are they started working or will work from today after you give the instructions?,Vikram is ready
I will start soon.,"I have started working on text summarization,  Varun haven't gone through anything itseems, So, anyway you learnt bit Mongo, even i learnt some mongo db"
Keep me updated regarding the project.,"Ok, I will post everything in the group from today"
Sure,Yeah
Why?,it is used for testing
We need it? <This message was edited>,"yeah, i have tested API in that only"
I will check it once again.,OK bro
Any way I'm going to practice on that too.,Nice
installed mongo,"Installed,  but some configuration issues"
I have installed <This message was edited>,Got your pc
"Yes, an hour back.",Oh nice
What kind of issues?,"It should run in the background,  but not running"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2M-rlkkT5o  I followed this.,Ok
latest,<Media omitted>
it will be on the right side of the screen,<Media omitted>
Yes,"Oh Shit, not kubernets operator"
<Media omitted>,But if kubernets works fine you can go with it
I have downloaded that only.,<Media omitted>
<Media omitted>,Ah it's correct
the Kubernetes is below the server one 🤣,<Media omitted>
"that's the link I copied, scroll up little inside the link it's there.","Not you the link you shared,  was like that"
scroll up and down its changing dynamically. How is that possible?,OK
Yes I saw in the task manager,No bro
I have installed terminal version also,OK nice
Yes,OK nice
The video I gave you has it.,While connecting did you put the URL
No',In compass
It will take by default,OK
you can see that here. <This message was edited>,Yeah got to know
Have to design the collections and documents,Yeah based on how the inputs are given while writing the mongo code
Right?,In collections you are giving the inputs and viewing it?
"I still haven't anything yet, I installed few minutes ago.",OK
I'm just asking that is our first task right?,Yeah bro right
Alright,"Bro if you get time, please teach me how to use git"
"It is, for all.",Maybe you can text me what and all the commands we use and how to get started
Sure. Let me get hands on it first.,Because we have to complete atleast 60 % of the project before college starts
"really, is it possible? 😳 What is the progress? How many started apart from you.","Varun haven't,  anyway Vikram no need to start until at least one back-end feature gets completed"
Then how 60%?,Varun is saying he will start after reaching Bangalore
Alright.,I will spend at least 6 to 8 hrs a day in this project
"oh, God.","As of now Text summarization is completed and PDF content extraction is completed,  next I have to send it to Gemini ApI to summarize or respond to the query and return it back to the user"
I'm confused a bit. Confirm me this - all these things handled by API's or you are writing code?,Next feature would be including OCR to extract text from image and respond to it via API
"Oh my God it looks so big. I will try to finish things as early as possible, probably before tomorrow.","OK bro, because only we 2 will be working till the college starts"
I didn't know all these things done. Have you updated all these in the group? It already created a pressure on me now. For lagging behind.,Varun said he will learn scripting
Let me start on it too.,OK bro
"Seeing all these works, Now I know how behind I'm. It should happen to others also, if not then give the updates.",OK I will.
Okay sure.,OK
My PC broke again.,Oh Shit
I'm fed up,Ok
I will check it out,Nice bro
Hope it doesn't break again,"Then,  you only write code to store these also"
I will,"OK,  as of now we have completed text summary and PDF summary. So you write code for both of these features"
In the same table?,Yeah
Okay,OK bro
Hi,Hi bro
"Hey and sorry I was working night so i messaged you then, and I slept throughout the day 😅","OK send it,  so I can make sure all the required fields are present"
Hey I'm actually asking whether I have to write the code for the pdf?,Have you wrote for text?
"No, no, for pdf I'm asking. Because I'm not sure how you have planned it.",My Java code will give you the extracted text from the PDF too... <This message was edited>
I'm just confirming with you before proceeding anything further.,You just have to create the fields and whenever the user inserts the data it will automatically save in the particular fields
Explain this.,Can we store files in mongodb
Yes but what about extracting?,Try to insert a file and see whether compass is showing that or not
Alright but look at my scenario above.,"Nope, only once the PDF will be taken from the user and only the extracted text will be used repeatedly.  No need to send the PDF again and again to the server for frequent retrievals"
How? <This message was edited>,"Yeah,  then let's store only the extracted text from the PDF and lets not store the PDF then"
What was your initial plan?,To extract keywords and provide the response based on the previous ones
Pdf is taken only once from the user. I'm not saying that one. I'm saying after taking if it stores the pdf directly in the mongo. Next when looking up for similar requests it will retrieve the pdf based on keywords and then extract it to get the content. And produces results.  Then again if the user requests something similar then it has to take the pdf again and extract it.  This is the scenario I thought where it would be a disadvantage.  Any thoughts on it? Because I don't know how you have planned these things. So i want to know if you had any.,"I am not getting it,  can I call you"
Okay if you are clear with the problems then we can proceed with that method only - storing the text instead of pdf. But it should be clear with you. Because it might have some disadvantages which I can't foresee now. And shouldn't a rise problem in the future.  We both should be clear on all things.,"anyway keywords and summarized text plays the major role in giving the response for similar queries right,  so we can cope up with this"
In that scenario summarised text won't be useful.,"In Q1, let's not save the PDF,  just the contents of the PDF need to be stored.   In Q2:- Now,  the query will search for the keywords and summarized text and not the original text and it will respond based on the previous response"
It needs to search in the original text again right?,Yeah
"If all is done, what's next? My task?","Yeah,  when the original text is there,  then no need of files,  as it will get complex for us to write code to retrieve the contents from the file again and again"
Shall I update in the group?,Yeah
I'm asking about extracting pdf one.,"OK bro write it, I can connect to my application using flask"
Alright. Update this as the next task in the group.,"If you have time,  then try to stores the file also. It may get used sometimes"
In different fields?,"Let's go with your idea,  to extract contents from the file if the user sends related queries"
Drop this then?,Look what fits better and implement it
Can't save in the same field.,Yeah even I came up with that idea
I will drop this. If we need we can add it later.,OK bro sure
Worry about the next tasks.  Let's not find solutions for the problems that still don't exist.,OK
"Don't take literal meaning. It's just a way to say ""say it fast."" 😜","My current task is,  accepting an audio file and summarizing it. I don't have any library to implement that in Java."
Let me check,I have found the API called Whisper API
If you are asking me to do it. Let me remind you I am very basic at python yet. So it will take time as I like to code only after understanding how to write it.,I understand
I prefer to understand before writing the code.,Yeah that's why I couldn't write code as I am completely in Java now
If you are okay then I will focus on learning python first then the libraries then I will implement that.,OK research about this try to understand and ping me if you can work with the feature
I will after I complete my learning process.,"OK,  can you give any estimated time. Because after completing all this features,  we do have lots of tasks to do"
I can't as I don't know how much there is to learn in python and also I'm working on my things too.,OK bro.
Still at basics,Nice
No one seems to be working on anything.,"By learning devops,  you can work on deploying our project in a platform"
Not for our ai project I'm saying generally.,Yeah maybe
Maybe,"What about Varun,  have he messaged about his domain."
He chose the full stack it seems.,OK
"I said i will ask for self study for networks, so he asked me to let him know what the hod will say.",OKayy
Which tasks?,Second task pdf
Why me? Any reason?,"Nope,  just asked"
Great.,OK
All right.,OK
What's your product name?,"Don't know bro,  as of now I am thinking to develop the product first"
"I came across an AI tool, called othergpt or something like that. Where if you give an input it will give results from all popular AI. And it works on token model instead of money.","Oh nice,  I will check it out"
Okay.,Ok
Haha pied piper is good one. It's a classic story in western world.,Yeah
"I need to understand the product, but in a literature way. Not in a technical way.","Oh OK, I will try to come up with this ASAP"
Alright.,OK
https://youtu.be/uCY43yxmIMI?si=V0FauN2ZhSK4NvaV,"Great,  but do you like the usecase of this?"
"Honestly speaking I don't find most of the AI any useful to me. Maybe people out who may use it. I just prefer the major AI as tools. These just come under the AI as a tool for certain tasks, but I have no interest in it.",Ok
I want to keep that as my backup.,"As of my knowledge, AI/ML is used to train models on data sets.  Like you said, we can train a model to understand indian accent based on the data sets i.e, Indian's conversations."
No not like that. What are we going to study? You learnt those things all these days right? How did you feel? What things need to be looked after to get better at it.,No I haven't started proper AI/ML
So you have taken it based on your interest alone.,Yes
Okay then I will see,OK
I will check it tomorrow.,OK bro
Alright,But consuming more time for more than 10MB size files
Like how much?,It is fast for files within 10MB
That much?,Yeah it will be a huge setback
To extract from audio right?,Yes
Can't do anything to it?,"To extract text from audio,  and send it to Gemini api and getting the summary back"
Like a single take?,This complete process
"You will take audio and send it directly to Gemini, that's all right?",yes
You talked about whisper ai right? That's from openai. Didn't use that?,Wait this needs huge work
"I'm asking you that, you send an audio file to the AI then it will work on it and send a response according to your request. Isn't that right?",I am using it
"I'm thinking of parallel processing or like a job scheduling to reduce the overhead, thus decreasing the time.",Firstly I am taking the input like audio and extracting the text from the audio using whisper AI and sending that text to Gemini api to respond keep summarize the text from whisper
Okay then you are using 2 different APIs.,"For image, I have used Tesseract to extract text from image"
Tell me about the audio for now. We need to reduce the time. 3-4 minutes is too much.,I am stuck
So no need of api to use whisper. Okay got it.,"No need,  I have downloaded an library and imported using python"
"Is this true only for the audio part? Or is it happening to normal text too? As it's summarising, is it normal for all?","Oh yes,  I have to optimize the algorithm, I have written in python"
Is it the same for all types of requests then?,For everything
It depends on the algorithm?,"Yeah,  I am also stuck there"
I didn't know that.,Maybe I need to walk through that
I'm not clear on the entire process of the project. Only up to date for db things.,If we use a better API to summarize then the time will get reduced
As in what you planned and done,"As of now we are using a basic model,  that's why they made it free"
Oh so other services are using paid ones.,yes
Like i didn't know whisper is a library you are using.,Like are you asking about the programming logic or any specific things? So that I explain or you didn't get how the entire process is working?
"I know how the project should work. But not the real work you have done. You said what all you have worked on, but I don't know how you achieved those things. Be it coding or algorithm.","Whisper a open source library,  and not an API. So, we can access it as a library"
Yeah I got to know only a few minutes back. Like that I don't know the technical proceedings.,Nope Gemini is just for summarizing
I understand it now. I think it's the same for others also.,Yes <This message was edited>
The entire process?,Like the technical things I have implemented
"Explain in the class, when they are there. It will be easier for you. Can't explain individuals.","OK sure,  Monday I will clear things"
And also tell us if you encountered any problem during the process and how or what you did to overcome it.,"Yeah I need to say these things to you guys, because this will help us a lot."
Right.,Yeah that's right
You are going to add in github?,Yeah it is one of the option I am considering
"It's still early to our project that's why I'm asking. But I don't know about it, as i never uploaded it.","OK bro,  if you got into it just let me know"
"Maybe it's good, making changes directly there.",Probably teach me
"I know git. It's just Linux. But we need GitHub. Have to practice once, and it's not hard.",OK bro
I will teach you in the class.,"Bro,  if the project completes Soon,  will you handle deployment"
Deployment could also mean putting into a server for wider use.  So which one?,"No,  it need to be launched as a website"
Free? Which one?,Like Vercel and Netlify like that
You know what is the imitation for requests and duration?,We need to share links if someone needs to access our website
Why? Then what's the point of deploying?,Nope
Well it is public then. Anyone with the link can access it.,yeah right I meant in this way
For testing we can deploy in local servers.,Yeah anyway I am doing testing. So deployment is needed
"Yeah, when it becomes we can never know when it can boost, so need a good server to handle it. <This message was edited>",Yeah
"For testing we can deploy in local servers, outside the network can't access it. So no public there to test, unless we let them inside the network.",OK got it.
Alright.,OK
From starting to deployment.,OK everybody needs to know about the project
Yes,OK
Yes,What kind of learning?
Latin,Oh you are learning a language
Yes I'm a polyglot.,"Just now googled about polyglot,  nice bro go on"
🤣 Google polymath too then,😂😀
I didn't see I was chatting in group,Oh really
I was chatting so comfortably and didn't realise it. <This message was edited>,"Haha it's OK,  we have to be open like that,  then only everybody will know  what is going on in the project"
Hmm right,Yeah
I'm not demotivating but telling you that it will be a huge problem in the future.,"Yeah bro,  I am not thinking big with this stuff."
"That's why I doubtful for this project regarding its limited members and time.  Even if there is a small feature it should work perfectly fine.  You are adding so many features, so the weight is more.  And we can't forget the security issues too.  We have work so that users don't get into problems.  For example I added the validation in mongo to take only a certain number of fields. So that the user or the frontend or the code accidentally doesn't send extra. This may be small but very useful.  Like this we have to think in all ways.",Yeah right!
I have two things to say.  Don't rush things. Don't add many features all at once. One at a time.,"Yeah yeah,  I am seggregating the features into parts. Like Microservices"
"Didn't your college projects had those things? While I was learning youtube they helped me to do these things in my college projects. From there I got it, and continued further in the company.",Bro what if you completely take this user handling and security part and all. Because I will surely lag on this.
Focus on one and work on it.  Should be the motto.,"Yeah. Back-end I am completing soon,  but look at the other things, f Our front-end guy is not responding properly."
No option then to wait.,"I understand,  what if people like our front-end guy  are not actively involving in this project"
I got it.,"Anyway I am testing it right,  so I was going on other features"
Think of it as a real world scenario. Do you think it works?,If we get the outputs faster we can march forward
I understand but looking from their perspective it's a holiday for them and not excited much for the project as it's not theirs. These things are common to arise. We need to give time for them by waiting.,Yeah
<Media omitted>,Oh OK
Just give them time.,Yeah agree
It's very important and used in almost all companies.,Ok
"If we follow these, we can complete it.",Yeah right
"Now, as the diagram says. There are 6 steps, but not for the entire application but for a single feature. It could be signup or login, etc.",Yes getting it.
"Another thing - if nothing is working then it's probably time for you to step up and do the work yourself.  Not for now, but for the future keep this in your mind.",Yeah bro I will work on this definitely
"I'm gonna ask a technical question, think and answer like a tech student.",Yes come on
"In sessions, you have mentioned login and logout time. So when the user logs in the userid and login time gets stored. So what will you do for logout time? You can't obviously store logout time at that time as you wouldn't know when the user is going to logout. <This message was edited>",We can add a feature like active and inactive.
How does it solve the logout time issue?,Sorry I edited it now
It still doesn't solve the issue.,It will
Explain it to me.,00:00:00
Exactly. This is the answer I needed.  Create - when user logs in Update - when user logs out,"If this won't work,  is there any alternate way or should I exclude this field"
"We can do this, but no need of active and inactive option as it's not a social media app.",Yeah
Excluding everything is that a problem will not solve anything. We need to solve it. That's what makes us software engineers.,Yeaaa
Yes. That's how I used it in my degree project.,"OK, let's not consider that"
Okay,OK bro
What you are trying for forgot password?,Sending a code to email like OTP
What is the process for that?,I have to provide fields like New password and all
The complete process for forgot password,Yesterday you only said to include all this
"I mentioned, like windows forgot password.",User clicks forgot password and enters his email.  Our back-end will send OTP to the email.  User enters the OTP in our tool and resets the password
It's much easier. But i still want to see your process for forgot password.,Then how can we know whether he is the user or someone is trying to access other's account
"In windows method? It's easy, by asking private questions which are filled by the user while signing up.","OK,  isn't that an old traditional way."
It's just easier to do. But you want otp one then we can. You have to do code for that.,"No, no not bad. OK if it's easy then we can consider this way only"
"We have see from all angles to know, which is best.",Yeah
"You can, but you have code.",Yeah I will do.
Okay,OK bro
"As per the time table, there is software engineering. It will be very important for you.",Yeah
"Starting from college, plan these things. Whether they will do it, or anyone else. How to handle college and the project. How to implement new ideas, as you will learn software engineering.",Yeah bro getting it.
"What you gave me today, the db one. We need certain prerequisites like the frontend to complete. Otherwise I will be in the same position as you are now. Completing only individual tasks. Which is not good. There needs to be coordination to finish the tasks, merge and complete it. <This message was edited>",Yeah we are on track. What if we put our hands on front-end too.
"I saw it now, it's because we have only 2 labs this time. It's good then.",Yeah
You are the leader. You think what's good. I can only recommend or suggest.,"Oh we are on the same level,  same table."
"Give it some time. In the meantime, work on something else.","He said he will not code,  he will generate code from a AI tool and will give the code for us. What do you think,  is this good for him and us?"
I was sceptical about it on that day. He said the same thing when you asked him in college.,But afterwards he said he will code
I didn't say anything on that day. I wanted to see how it would turn out.,"Yes human touch is needed  . Yeah we need that guy to understand the design and more and also AI cannot solve the errors,  it makes worse"
See how you want. If a person is needed. Then who will do it? Who else knows react.,He is not at all interacting in the group even we mention him also. Then there will be a huge lag in frontend
"What about Varun? I won't be needing the backend anymore. I will handle it myself. If he starts, he will already be behind. I thought I and him can do it during the holidays. But it didn't worked that way.","Yeah right,  you alone is enough for db,  let me ask him for frontend"
You need people who are interested in your project more than who knows what. At least in interest they will learn and do.,"Bro but varun also said the same,  that he will use a tool and generate code"
*without learning.,Yeah that's 100% right.
"He does? And also another thing to consider. Will he be there for the project throughout its duration or leave it after doing the frontend.  If he is going to stay, then we can work with him. So that he could work on changes we need.",OK let me confirm with him and I will push him to start work ASAP
Okay,OK bro
"I have tried in chatgpt some time ago, it says it can't process videos as of now. Didn't try again.","Dont know, i think it takes the captions to process"
No use then. You are saying that it takes the hindi captions and translates into English. That's basic AI stuff then.,no just links
Okay. I too have tried with links only. Maybe I should try video files.,"After converting, it summarizes."
The ai I mentioned adds the subs directly to the video.,Oh nice.
Yeah that's basic AI stuff. Which we have been using in Google translate for ages. Tell me if it does something I have mentioned otherwise it's not interesting. There should be innovation not just copy and paste.,Video files uploading takes more time
It surely does.,"Yeah right, nothing interesting."
"That's why from then, I never worked on management projects again. Although I worked on chat and db projects but they are only to know C deeply. Nothing else.",Hmm agreed.
"Even if we work as a team, there should be something new. That actually solves people's problems.",Right
Solving people's problems. Small things matter very much.,Yeah.
"It's just my experience to stand out in companies, our projects should be unique and solve real world problems. Otherwise we are just sheep going in a group as the company leads.",You can see the time stamp of the query here
Saw.,Yeah right.
Shall I add?,Yeah I will
Let's complete the first phase of the project then we can think of bringing something new.,"Bro, why these teachers are dumping these wishes in the group. HOD wished right, then why should these teachers also dumping"
Force of habits for uncles and aunties just like sharing Good morning and good night 😂😂😂,🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂   Yea right
"I thought of another 2 features while bathing, looks like it went into the drain along with the water 😢",😂😂haha
You know dark humour?,I can understand a bit
😂,Nope
The salesman was disgusted with his answer.,"Oh , but I didn't find any humor in this"
Okay watch this  https://youtube.com/shorts/XznCxGFR86Y?si=poLHNjfzWj7OILD9,Oh OK I will see some then
"Okay if you don't know, having a relationship with a minor is a very serious thing in the West. It should be in India too. But not many talk about it.  So when talking about kids, people will give a weird reaction to it in the West because it's a taboo.",😶
😂😂,Oh really
"He says he got caught while blowing smoke in the bathroom  The other guys hear it  Another guy comes and the first guy says hey what's up smoke.  2nd guy gives a weird reaction, because blowing also means giving blowjob.  So in his context, he was caught giving blowjob to that guy 😂😂",Oh OK now I got it 😂😂
Tell me if you get it,Got this atlast 😂 <This message was edited>
😂,Haha the related one. Understood 😂
"If anyone says this in the West, there is a higher probability that he will get arrested. It's a serious thing. Sad, we don't take it seriously about these minors in India.",Oh OK
I'm not watching news,They will make us to react to war like situations like precautions and bomb blasts
You know anything specific they will do?,Yeah wait I will send you a post
https://youtube.com/shorts/9rpA_3ELsxI?si=k2Iq9JEUkvgI8Dal  Watch this,https://www.instagram.com/p/DJWRDGfzmIr/?igsh=MWxvMDV2eTV5OHV4OQ==
Hyderabad or Bengaluru?,https://www.instagram.com/p/DJUg-6MSvUS/?igsh=cnBjM3Rnd2VhbXhl
Will it affect us in any way?,"Oh fuck,  this is awesome and easy to understand the humor"
How? I didn't get it. Crores of people are there. How will they teach?,hmm yes
I don't like wars. It only brings ruins.,Like the outskirts of bengaluru
Okay,Yeah
If it happens it will take us behind economically and financially.,Yeah that's what everyone is scared out
"I don't understand why people are celebrating. They like movies, our army will kill all Pakistanis. While in reality even our army will die. It's a two way sword. Hurts both of us.  Pakistan anyway is a doomed country. They will die on their own. What's use in killing an already dead snake. Only we have everything to lose.",Yeah.
Most of them are celebrating. They think it's a game or movie. Where the hero kills thousands of them and comes back without a scratch.,Yeah even some big names too
I stopped questioning them with logic. They just don't understand and believe everything in the news.,Yeah right aggreeable <This message was edited>
You know how many times people tell me to leave this country 😆 Because I question them. It will be futile to expect logic from fools.,Yeah what to do with this Shit people
Just ignore and let them rot. Because we are being ruled by these kinds of people only.,Yeah
https://youtube.com/shorts/7kx2pnnQnuU?si=3V15oNx5nobR_cv2  I don't know how authentic is this. But look he is generating a video along with summarising it with his own style.,Awesome
Did you ask her where? I think it's from swayam they are saying to do.,Nptel
I keep getting calls and i reject it if the contact is not saved. So no idea if hod called.,oh OK 😀😂
From the swayam app you can access that.,OK bro. Is it free or paid.
"It's free, from the government. But need to write an examination for certification. I think it's over, don't know if they keep exams twice a year.",OK
🤦🏻,Oh Shit you didn't choose then
She gave any more info on it? Like which tech or when to do? Or anything.,OK.  Speak with your hod
I will. Tomorrow. I will give him a letter.,She asked to complete within 3rd sem
In oct? After exams?,Maybe
Have you seen the project list?,Okay....what do you think can this current project get to that level? Or should we have to do an other one.
See,Ok
Check with your mentor.,Ok
"I don't plan to do a project for funding.  They expect something else, and I'm not interested in doing it.",OK.
"Those projects didn't bring any interest in me, so I'm dropped the idea to do only for funding.",OK let me see the list.
See,I am not interested in these kind of. These are like management systems kind of. I definitely don't want this.
Right. That's why I dropped the idea.,Yeah OK
"I'm currently working on projects related to my work, but they are so little. Can we be done in days.","Yeah right. No bro,  but let's come up with something more interesting."
Something groundbreaking......,Yeah definitely......
"Let's see, if hod permits networks, then i will think based on it.","OK,  go with peer to peer it will be a really good addition"
Just for fun they are doing it.....,"Haha,  but it looks really awesome"
"Especially, data structure.",yeah I understand .
"Maybe a browser, or private internet. These are bigger projects.",OK nice.
Ja,yes
"I wanted to work on the browser, but it needs c++. With java anna python in college can't learn c++",Oh right!...But youy can parallely do
All 3?,"Leave any of one, study jus for exam sake"
Yes I need python for my job.,Yes
"Let me see how both goes, especially Java. If it's easy then i will proceed.",Ok bro.
So i need to learn Java correctly.,Oh Ok bro
"So, It can be done but I'm not sure in C.","Oh nice, OK."
Which app you are talking about?,OK
"Can't say generally, depends on type of app.",Ok
"As it uses the client-server model, and both needs to be designed.",Ok
"in Chat project, while doing did it work on different machine when connected to same network? or didn't worked only when not connected to same network?",It didn't work on different machines on the same network
oh,And haven't checked on different network
If it didn't worked on same then it won't on different network too,Yeah
"I will let you know once If i get to know how to do it, but it will be in python so you may need to merge it with the chat project",OK I will do the merging part if the issue gets resolved
it will complete then,Yeah right.
I need the frontend to proceed,For chat?
for AI,"Yesterday I messaged him, he said he is generating code in firebase studio"
"Like i said that day, the project needs to worked by all, otherwise like what happened to you. Even i have to work individually which is not ideal to complete the project.",Yes
"Okay tell him to update things in the group, with code he also needs to explain how it works, then my work comes and later your work comes to merge it.",But still he didn't
holidays are almost over.,Generating code and sending it won't take much time. Can be done within hours. But still he didn't send
what will you do then?,Only option is to wait.
okay in the meantime doing DSA?,"But our work is vast,  we can't."
he has taken AI but Varun has taken full stack,Yeah bro. Attempting a hard question now from 8 o clock
topic?,<Media omitted>
use your time that way,Sliding window
great,"Yeah, very interesting topic."
I saw for sum,"Using hashmaps, moving the left and right pointers, getting the size of the current window like substring and comparing with the required output sequence."
"oh, sounds good",Yes.
especially need hashmap,Ok
"need to learn, don't know anything about it",Ok bro.
looks like IPL will be called off,Yes
today's match called off,Yeah saw
yes. War is scary.,😔
saw what happened in poonch?,Nope
they killed our people. 15 dead,Oh bro why they are targeting civilians.
most of indians think there won't be casualties our side. Look what happened,Yeah
You expect right from them? As a matter fact all of them were killed were muslims. They don't care about us,Yeah yeah.
40% of indians never experienced war period. Last was in 90's,Yes
it affected me so much.,Oh really.
"Yes. Most know only one side of the story. I was preparing to write a anti-war novel then so I tried researching other side of the story, but it was so disturbing. I didn't even finish the novel.",But India is neutralizing all the missile attacks from Pakistan let's see
"during Kargil network was cutoff. But back then there was not much portables mobiles. But now, everyone has it. Networks will be cutoff to avoid communication. And more over we depend on UPI so much. So it will affect financially hard. There are lot of things to see",Shit
Hard times ahead.....,Yeah
"It's going to be completely network specific, so I'm not sure to ask you to work on it. You may not get useful things from it. But if you still want then I'm always okay with that. But if you don't then also I'm okay, i can understand it's not related to your domain. But it's better you understand what that project is.",Oh nice
"It's like a private network, where there will be no or limited censorship. There will be a dedicated webpage which users can access, but they can't access the outside or normal internet. It provides anonymity, especially for people who want freedom of speech.",OK sounds good.
From chatgpt,OK nice.
Alright.,OK nice idea.
"It does need a UI on the web, according to me. But like you I have to know about it, and develop code first then the development part comes. <This message was edited>",Yeah right!
"No, as most of the work is on the network side. I doubt anyone wants to work on the network side as there is no subject on it.",Many of them will be interested because the idea is good.
If computer networks were available then it would be a different thing.,Yes
Haha come on you are saying this after seeing how your project is going?,😂
"It's still the starting phase, so I will wait.",OK bro.
https://youtube.com/shorts/iQydw-MgwNI?si=goUo3yi9Qy_dvTfe  Similar to your YouTube summarization. Made more accessible and good features.,"Oh Man! Yes,  this looks good"
Yeah,Hi bro
Is Mongo running?,Nope it is refusing to connect
list out the components needed to connect.,Tried with different ports but it couldn't
So from mongo side issue? Did it run that day?,Yes it was running
Tell me what are needed to connect and run it?,"God,  After re-installing it is connecting now."
good then.,And the previously entered data is also available
okay,But we need to figure out why is this happened
I need to know more information on it. To know! <This message was edited>,I am writing code for user authentication like the email thing we discussed earlier
Alrighty.,Even I am figuring out.
"tell me this - for the whole project till you now, you have done.",Shall I explain it tomorrow in class
Alright. Check in stack overflow if not chatgpt,I am not getting
No I'm asking what are all you using? Till now I only know Mongodb compass and can run python code to connect and save data in mongodb.,Like the tech and API's I am using?
"If you want to know why a certain issue comes in coding, stack overflow is the way, it is a forum. If you didn't know about it, then you should. Programmers are expected to know this. Check it out.",OK
No. The things needed that is connecting. How are you connecting spring boot to mongodb? is it same as running python program? And what are other things have you used to connect like spring boot.,<Media omitted>
same as python then. Are there any other things you are using? like this?,I will store this URL in my springboot application and while running it will detect and connect to the mongo db
Got it.,<Media omitted>
"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59057856/unable-to-connect-to-mongodb-in-spring-boot-application  This is how it looks. This forum may not be the right one for your issue, given the context given I googled it. AI doesn't always give the right answers, but humans do.","Tesseract,  PDFbox, ffmpeg"
Ooooooo - so many things.,yeah
I'm checking one by one.,OK OK
Seeing this - It's scares me to include the project in the resume; I don't know major things in it. I checked them now. Need to understand more.,Yeah this is complex
"spring boot is java right, java also we are using. Maybe need python too.",For mail and all we have to use another dependency now.
Oh,Yeah spring will provide development Tools to use with Java code like dependency injection and more
🙁,What happened?
So many things are needed.,Yes
Do all AI use the same methods or they will build their own?,They will build their own using ML.
Full stack!! Can you tell me what are the things we are going to use ahead? Apart from React and Mongo.,That's it.
Is it because they don't want to share the data?,We will not use any more technologies from now on
ok,Maybe.
MmM,Don't know bro
"I started a Linux project yesterday, almost finished need to work on tomorrow to complete it.",Oh nice
I will come. I don't want the repeat the same thing 🥲,OK 😀
"An ad-blocker. It blocks all ads from all the devices connected to my router. I'm fed up of youtube ads on TV, so decided to build one.",Oh nice bro.
Need to meet mentor. Let me know if your mentor tells anything about future regarding anything. I don't want to ask the HOD regarding. Too risky.,Haha 😂 OK
Thought of building an VPN but it won't probably work on OTT's. You know with the right VPN you can access restrict content in OTT's from other countries.,Nice
These requires very less techs as its jobs are limited too. That's why your list of techs took breath away from me.,Ok
IPL restarting.....,Oh really date?
"Next week, Thur or Fri onwards. 1st match will be RCB vs LSG","Oh come on,  will it happen in India or?"
"Only in South India for now, especially in Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad.",OK nice
ECB offered but BCCI will not do. crores of rupees lose for BCCI if done.,In some random insta post
Please no!,Ok
Instagram is not a good source 🤐 Never use that as a source. My cousin was using it to keep track of wars 🤣,"Nope,  from a trusted news media channel in instagram"
"I heard nothing. Only ECB offered, just like during covid. But BCCI wants 🤑🤑🤑",Haha yes
Past 2 days people on tweeter are wondering why no media is non trustable. Indian media ranks 151 out of 180 in the world. <This message was edited>,Oh oh
Only thing they care is TRP and buzz not actually media. My life is good ever since I stopped watching any news 🙏🏻,Yeah saw it
We need trustable source.,Yes <This message was edited>
Journalism is supposed to question the governments. Not dance according to  the government's tune. <This message was edited>,Yes <This message was edited>
"I have written the letter to give tomorrow for networks, hope he accepts it.",OK bro
Coming for placements?,No
I got a bad feeling about it.,Ok
Coming to lab?,Yes bro
In class,Nothing
Okay,Not coming today?
No. I didn't feel well. Tomorrow I will try.,OK bro
Anything important?,"Java just started,  SE some concepts done,  DBMS she made us to write some theory in the PPT totally she didn't explain anything really time waste. And that's it"
Alright,SE mam said she will share a test link for course beginning survey. And she will close the after 10-15 mins after posting
Did she?,Nope not yet
Anything on the project?,AI project?
Yes,I will work on the email and authentication Part possibly today or from tomorrow.
Okay,If you Feel OK then you can work on file storing part <This message was edited>
"Okay. I got a problem in my right hand so couldn't use pc. Once i get it right, i will do it. <This message was edited>",Oh what happened?
Still unclear. For 3 days it's been burning inside. It might get well tomorrow. Probably using the PC over last week.,OK
No it's neither muscle nor bones. Probably nerves. If it sustains till tomorrow I will probably have to check it.,OK take care
Sure will,Oh OK
Anyway let's see. I will start soon on the project. Need to work on mine too.,"OK bro,  give some time to heal or it may start again."
Alright 👍🏻,Ok
Learn about it and let me know. I can't use my phone much.,Yes.
Let me know tomorrow.,Unable to go through about it today. Will notify you once I start maybe from tomorrow
Okay,<Media omitted>
Like roleplay.,Yes
Need to check again if there are improvements in it.,"Oh really OK  ,I will try it"
You are using deepsearch?,Okay
Okay.,I am interested in the anime part like turning inputs into a video
Oh,"But this will be complex,  I think it requires lots and lots of time."
To write the code?,Yeah right.  Language is the primary thing yes
Got it,Yeah for the end to end development
Okay,Yes right.
Think about it more. We need features which can accommodate simplifying things for Indians.,Yeah OK I will research on it.
Alright.,Ok
Alright,How is your hand?
Any updates?,OK bro
Anything from others?,Oh bro take care! Take your time I will manage your work till then
Varun returned right?,We are RCB fans
Oh,He will come Bangalore Sunday it seems
"I have to start learn react. If others don't then I will look at it. Anyway it's a win win situation for me. As, I need to learn it. <This message was edited>","Yeah OK bro nice,  it will be a great add on to your skill set"
"Okay if things don't go our way, then I will do backend + frontend. I will do basic designs for the web. But your project should come to mobiles also. So you should think about it. <This message was edited>",Android development is bit tough from web development. Let's see
"For ease of use, I thought of bots. Designed for specific use. Which people can use it for that particular use. See if it's feasible.",I have locked this as one of my idea :- Taking input of any form from the user and converting it into an animated video.
Alright.,For the funding one
"I'm focusing on Indians because outside they have various AI to use. But not for Indians. And you could sell it as ""make in India"". So providing what Indians need is necessary. And also major Indians are not technically good. So need to keep in mind that also.  Provide them what other AI don't give Or Provide them what they want in ease what they can't get from other AI (reducing complexity)",I am interested in that persona's part
Converting video requires a lot of money. So you need it.,Perfect.  I will be specific about this
But you can't have both ways.,Yeah right. I will focus on the current features we have decided till right now
You didn't ask what are the 2 ways.,Yeah yeah
"Two ways go like this.  One is whatever you are trying now, adding more features. (I didn't brought hike messenger example for this). You will add more features using API and libraries. But those features already exist in other AI. So your product could be a copy of it. Unless there is something special you are adding to it.   The other way is, taunting targeting a specific group (like Indians) and making an AI which helps them. But current features won't do anything to them. So you won't like this method. I can understand. At the same time it has more chances of becoming successful than the former. As it's not done by any major AI. But as I said you might not like this. That's totally understandable.  But you can't have both in your product (for having both ways I gave an example of hike). So think about it. I considered your project to be a product, so it might sound harsh. But i don't intend any harm. As I will work either way on the project. It's just my opinion. Not a fact of course. You have your mind to see what's better.",Okay I totally understand. What kind of features we  can implement to target Indian audience? I am eager to work on the 2nd way too.
I can help you with it. For both ways. I'm ready.,"Yeah,  but let's finish this project and we can dive into that."
WhatsApp was brilliant. They rolled out one by one taking their time.,Yeah
That's why I said take your time and decide. You might not like working on this. 😢,Yeah let's do proper reasearch and get the requirements.
Alright.,Maybe Vivek is very curious about it and he already has some knowledge in ML.
You need to think about your future. What if your project gets successful? You alone won't be enough for maintaining it.,Yeah right.
Okay. Ask him then.,Yeah but let's gather the requirements first and we can pitch it to him
"Even for other things like backend and frontend you need members from AI. I will do my work now. But as time passes we go separate ways, probably getting jobs. Then you need someone to maintain that thing also.",Yeah I am getting it.
I will say wait. Let's complete the working project. It would be better if we show what has been done. Frontend + backend + AI. Especially the text summarization should be there.,Yeah this is right OK
I'm concerned for both of us. We have good ideas for projects but don't have support from others. Everyone seems to have the same child's mindset. Living like schools. No one is scared of the future. No one wants to do anything for the future. Do they think they all get jobs?,"Yes, right! I don't think so"
It's really concerning. If we don't update ourselves we are not getting any jobs.,Yeah Microsoft ones
Building our own startups is the best now. But it has its own hurdles.,Yeah right!
<Media omitted>,What would be the timeline you would consider or expect to complete the Indians specific project
And meeting the people who have the same interests.,Sad to see this and scared too.
"It depends on what project? Is it like WhatsApp? Where a series of updates will be rolling on and on. Or an app like file manager, where very rarely it gets updates. Or an offline game where it gets released after it is completely finished, no updates. <This message was edited>",OK let's begin this as fast as we can.
Let's see.,"If we mention this projects in resume,  then we will be on the top."
Yes surely. That's why projects are important. Also what projects we have done.,Yes
Honestly speaking I'm disappointed with both the college and the students. None of them are very serious. They are focusing on little things.,We can design our own voice assistant and it can predict sentiments
Like in the web browsers?,Yes
Predict sentiments? Explain me this.,But it reads everything thing. We can be specific about some messages from specific person or something like that.
No No. I asked is it like that? And yes we can have it.,"If I had a girlfriend, if she angrily messages me, then our tool can express it in the same angry way. If she messaged me lovely,  then it reads with almost happiness."
"I'm not sure about it. You may need to research about it. My concern is what if it predicts wrong? After all it's AI. Like, it reading a serious messages as a joke or more importantly reading a joke as a serious thing?",What if we give access to it about the previous messages and it can predict sentiments from the past messages
"Before adding something like this, you need to research and see both ways. There was a case where an AI convinced a teenager to commit sucide. From last year I think.",We can finely tune it. Requires lots of time and training
Still too risky. It's still an AI. It may not get all jokes. Especially darker ones. Have you tried giving a dark joke in chatgpt and asking for an explanation. It won't give and ends the conversation.,"Our tool won't do anything out of the box like giving suggestions and all,  it just reads the messages with sentiments"
The message will go through an AI right? There is also a privacy issue if it goes through AI.,AI will be written by us and it will be stored in our servers
I sent a joke once. It was a classic British humour. A guy comes to a bar and says he just had sex with a woman on the street. For that bartender asks whether she had a head.  He was trying to joke that he had done with a beheaded woman. As it's not common to get a woman and do with her in public. I sent this to chat chatgpt it didn't reply to me and ended our conversation.,It will be useful for disabled people.
Text to read is useful but I'm talking about sentiments features.,"Yeah, and we are not storing their messages because we don't use sentiments here."
"Ask AI about this feature, anything risks in it.",OK
I doubt it.,OK let's keep it as an optional one and let's search for other problem statements
Okay.,"Designing a feature that reads WhatsApp messages with emotional intonation based on sentiment is technically feasible and quite innovative. However, it must be handled very carefully due to privacy, legal, and ethical concerns. Here's a complete breakdown:"
We can add as many features. But we should consider the future problems arising with it. It's saying the same thing. It has issues with privacy.,Yes
Read out loud is good but not the sentiment one.,"Yeah at the end I said about this without sentiments,  just read and write"
Anything important in classes.,.
Good.,SE going like 🚀
What have she done till now?,And yesterday I haven't went to college
"Oh, okay.","Completed all the 3 models like agile,  incremental and re use"
Da fuck? All done so early?,And she is explaining the steps one by one with separate diagrams
Okay,Yeah
I'm watching a react tutorial but I'm not able to understand most of it. Are there any requirements for it?,"Javascript will be the foundation,  if you are good at it,  then I think you can understand bro."
They were talking about some classes or objects I think.,"Oh this is the base to learn react bro,  most of the people use to say like this."
Okay I will learn in class only. I thought about finishing early.,OK bro
Yes,Okay
Has ma'am done enough in DBMS classes to do it in the lab?,No
Got fever?,Yes bro from yesterday night
Good then,Yeah
Did type casting and arrays in Java.,Haha yes right.
Which one?,<Media omitted>
Have they sent any messages like that?,Have you filled the form
"Srinivas was telling, all need to select DBMS. I'm not sure about it.",OK
But I don't see any messages like that.,Really OK
"That's why I'm asking you, i might have missed the message. I'm too confused","OK Varun just messaged me to select DBMS course,  to skip assignments like that"
"Oh, okay",Compulsory itseems <This message was edited>
Who told him.,Don't know I didn't ask
Okay,Yeah
Oh really,Yes
It has two jobs. Right?,"Yeah,  I have to use NLP for thiw now"
Oh fuck 🤦🏻,Yeah summarization and recommendations based on the summary
Is it easy? How do you rate it on difficulty?,"I don't have any idea about this,  I will have to learn"
Problems always come when doing any projects but never expected it will affect the core feature of the project.,But I am getting a suggestion that I can use other Model like API to to do the recommendations job
"Oh, it sounds difficult to me.",Yeah
"Oh great, which ones?",But those are paid ones
I never researched about these. So I don't have any idea. What about openai? Is that also paid?,Yeah
Yes it's paid i checked now.,Yes <This message was edited>
Any solution for this problem?,NLP is the only way. But learning and implementing it takes time. It will extend the project completion time
How about forming team members and all working on it? You can finish it early by that way.,Sounds good. Who knows NLP?
Me? I don't know anyone.,Nobody knows NLP as of my observation <This message was edited>
It will be a win-win situation for you as well as them.,"Yes, my job will be finished if I Implement this in the project"
Definitely.,"Yeah, but they may take more time because the project is not their own. Because they maybe busy with their things <This message was edited>"
Yes it's true but You can't do anything in it. Try talking about this project with your mentor or your lecture for help. They might help you recruiting members.,"Oh really,  let me try with my mentor."
It's a highly impossible and risky thing. Because you don't have much time if you target placements. But if you are confident enough that you will build your project into a real project then you can do that. Building a complete software by a single person is highly difficult. Think about it.,"Yes,  I will try via my mentor or I will reach out people"
Kaggle - this one i think.,"Nope, that is hugging face"
What about it?,Let me try it
Okay and let me know.,OK bro
"And before adding members for NLP, prepare yourself with it. So that others don't overtake you and start leading it. You are leading and it should be like that.",Yeah right
This things happens.,Yeah I agree with this
Coming tomorrow?,Yes bro I will try to
Okay if you come let's try to pitch your idea if you are ready. Or you want time?,To whom?
If you want.,She may not help bro. I will reach out other guys. Let me see
Okay then,She may ask only students from our mentee group to incorporate
Can he help?,So. I will find some guys who are really useful
Okay.,"He said he is learning and teaching us, how can he help"
As a matter of fact none of the lectures can help in our projects 😅 I have experienced this in degree too 😄,Yeah I will find people with similar interests and I will pitch my idea to them if they are really interested
Okay then,OK bro
Who?,Vikram
He was working on it??? I didn't know about it. By work means generating from ai or he was coding?,Generating using AI. Then also he is not giving any outputs or updates on it.
🤦🏻,"OK, Yes right."
I was able to catch most of the things today in class. So I will pick it up but slowly.,Nice
Varun didn't understand so I explained to him a little bit what react is and what it does.,Okay
Okay then it's getting late.,Ok
Bye,Hi bro
You can gamble by only learning Java. You need to try other techs too especially if it's needed in your project.,They may not teach this importing modules and writing code for that to use and all
Companies expect that. That's why I decided to learn full stack correctly along with networks. You can try too. It's a need of the moment.,Yes
They may not teach anything useful for our work. That's where self learning comes in.,Yeah.
You can learn python from class what I meant. But for the project you have to do self learning.,I can copy the code in chatgpt. But it makes no sense
I won't recommend it.,Yes
Good.,Knew it
Learn as much as possible especially if the project demands it. More techs = more package,Yeah I need to
"When I was in degree, there were roles like testing, frontend and backend. They were all separate and we were supposed to prepare for it. Now look what has happened, full stack came. And now everything must or can be handled by a single person.",Yeah right
"For now, suppose for a resume. What techs will you put? Just asking to know how much you know.",Java with spring framework is mandatory one for me.
Just list out the techs. It's fine,"JAVA, CSS, JS,  C,  Python (if I complete learning). React (within July I will try to learn again)"
*projects,"Yeah I will mention a facial recognition app,  which I did in my degree by identifying people's hair,  color and more.  And Chat application using C"
Any other projects?,I have explained this to you before some time
Then you know c#?,Tourism management system.
It helps to plan and work towards it.,"Then, my resume will not look good"
AI is meant to be useful to us. So we should use it likely.,Yeah I want to
Then specify your desired role in a company.,"After 4-5 months I will apply for AI-ML role. But now I will go with Development role,  because still I have not explored any"
Right. Okay got it. I will check with both.,Ok
"I got the results. Assuming you do very well in an interview.  If you go for a development role, especially in a service company you can expect - 3.5-5 lpa.  For startups - 6-9 lpa.",OK
Note that it's based on your current skills not the end of your time period. So you can probably increase it.,Yeah got it.
3.5-5 is too less. But getting a good start up is also hard.,Yeah
"I got this for AI but I can't understand fully but you may get it. It recommend this project -  Projects:  Real-world datasets from Kaggle  Build at least 2 solid ML projects (image recognition, NLP app, or a recommender system)",I will be implementing the last one in the current project
For AI/ML  Services - 5-7 lpa Start ups - 7-10 lpa,I will explore more NLP based
Okay. Let me check for the projects too then. About the expectations.,Yeah I am parallely practicing DSA too
You got what I'm asking right?,"Nope,  I was in back-end"
Alright.,Yeah training the models. Got it.
So with 4-5 months as you said you need to learn code. You should probably go to the AI side in the 3rd sem too.,Yeah yeah
Take your time cause it needs time. It's obviously harder than traditional development roles.,Yeah
Don't rush your current ai project. Train the models as you said instead of using API's.,"OK,  that's a interesting part,  like making words shorter and encoding or pushing to the machine to understand quickly. And this is a important process in preprocessing"
Sounds great to me.,Ok
And?,"There are many processes too like tokenization,  indexing, classification"
Okay you learning those?,Lemmetization is similar to stemming
From YouTube?,"Yes  , got a link from github repo and it is well organized"
"Okay, cool",Yeah
Checking with chatgpt? Are you asking that?,I am asking you.
Devops is less learning more doing. I can learn all the techs in a month. But i need first hand experience from it. So i need to work on a lot of projects. Based on devops techs.,Okayy
It's a demanding role. Well paid.,Nice
That's why I chose it 😶,Knew it..
If i improve my coding skills then I can move to SRE - it's a high paying job more than devops.,Oh nice. SRE?
The abbreviation - Site Reliability Engineering,OK
Jack of all trades - my personality and devops suits it very well. That's what I love about it.,Nice
https://youtube.com/shorts/0wpt2f2aprQ?si=V-K7W1MQwLPb4ZNt  Check the 3rd,Bro anything important in today's class
I didn't go,OK bro
Ignore the sound.,What happened ?
"Planning to watch RCB matches from now on, on this.",Oh nice
Blue painted wall 😢 But imagine playing on white screen.,Okay
I watched the world cup on this. And we won. Maybe it's time for RCB.,"Oh come on bro,  please watch all RCB matches in this one only"
😂 That's what I'm planning.,Oh OK
Going to placements?,"Probably yes,  because I have missed last two sessions"
Nope.,Ok
Everyone is. No one's interested.,OK Nice bro
Read?,Reading now
Summarise using AI. It has a lot of things so.,Sad to see this. Less than 200 downloads
With good prototypes you can get funding.,But most of them don't know how to use hugging face to access this model  . So that would be the reason
"They are failing because they are not providing anything else what other major AI is providing. Every set of people based on regions have different requirements. If one cracks it, the business will boom. <This message was edited>",Yes
Might be. So it's your chance.,Yeah I thought the same
Need to brainstorm.,Even I thought so like sentimental analysis with different personas
There is a language issue. Many don't know english. With voice provided it would be a plus.,Yeah right
These are basic requirements or problems that need to be solved.,Yes yes
What about language? Will it use english?,We can tune it to understand different languages
Oh okay,Yeah sounds good
"Not just websites, even redirect to YouTube with best or suitable video.",Yeah got it.
"Anyway you need to learn about these and implement, which every feature they are.","Yeah, I have to speed up my learning thing"
Yes. There is a market waiting. So getting it depends on you.,Yeah.
No i didn't,OK bro
Anything important?,Nope
It's really working.,Man!!!  I didn't expect this fiery from jitesh
No,Yes
My projector 📽️ 🤣,Oh right right 😂😀
I watched it on mobile till the 13th over of LSG batting. And remembered I turned on the projector.,"Look at virat bro,  he is celebrating like craxy"
Yeah,Oh really OK
After 9 years RCB into the top 2. That's why.,Haha yes that's true
"The highest was 210 I think. From last year, Will Jacks played a blinder against GT.","Haha yes yes,  afternoon match I remember"
Jitesh fucked up captaincy in bowling in both matches so it was time for him to stepup.,Fuck Digvesh bro
Yes. Virat was very impressed.,Yeah right right
Also RCB is the only team in the history of IPL to win all away matches.,Yes right.
Haha he was in the rule book. But it was childish of him. When he couldn't take his wicket. He tried it. But good Pant reversed it.,Yeah yeah
I expected more from Salt. He has been disappointing. Hope he is saving from the playoffs. <This message was edited>,Virat gave flying kiss after a long time from the middle of the ground to Anushka
Haha saw,Yeah maybe
He wants to win. For the fans before he goes away.,Even patidar couldn't contribute. But acceptable because of his injury
"I still wonder why he tries more against pace and does not save himself for spin. But anyway Mayank is there, he plays well against spin. Livingstone too plays against but he has been nothing but a disappointment.",Yes true.
"Virat didn't go for a single six. Maintained well with fours. Which he is known for. But tried to open it but got out. He should stay, he is very important. Anyway the record stays on - every time Virat scores a fifty, RCB has won.",Yeah. The man.
Do you have shortage of attendance?,Yes bro
Met your mentor?,Nope. I didn't go
Will you? <This message was edited>,"They have just put the message,  but they didn't ask us to meet right then"
Okay,Take the record books tomorrow
You got it?,Yeah
Okay,Ok
This one for?,This is for record books
Alright got it.,Yeah OK
Any update?,On project
Yes,I have started working on the data pre-processing part for keyword extraction and recommendation using NLP <This message was edited>
English please 🥺,What?
What does it do,"Like I have collected data sets from kaggle and mine too. And now I'm indexing it,  stemming will be done and I have to classify words based on precedence."
"If you do this, will usage of API reduce?",The data I was using for testing purpose and some raw data from kaggle also
Oh then it's good.,But we can't replace Gemini API easily in the project.
Even if we reduce it. It will be good.,Because we can't get that much huge amounts  of data and cannot process it and all. It's a huge one
Hmm,Yeah let's try reducing it's usage
Alright,OK bro
<Media omitted>,🔥🔥
<Media omitted>,😂😂
Oh. Even for counting numbers in a loop it takes forever. That's why python didn't replace java or c despite it's huge library.,Oh OK
What was it about?,Fuck them.
What do you mean? <This message was edited>,"That Jagriti yatra program  , they have posted in group"
Woke up now?,It is an entrepreneurship program like travelling in a train for eight days and visiting fifteen states tier 2 companies and start-ups.
Oh 😳,Useless it is for us
Who will even go?,Nobody except the entrepreneurship cell guys <This message was edited>
I thought it would be another useless event. So I came from the right side. Varun too came but he said he will go. So I went without looking back and it seems Ranganath sir caught me leaving so he has asked Varun to call me 😆,Yearly 80000 people register by paying 100 rs and only 500 will get selected from that and they have to pay one lack rs for the travel
"He called that sir is calling for me, I was already on the 5th floor. I didn't want to go and then he said it's okay sir left. So I came home.",OK OK
What's the point lmao. It's utter nonsense.,Yeah
But what did they do in 1 hour?,"The guy who came for promoting this,  is like making us get scared of the technological advancements happening"
Ok,"And he is making Shitty fun of us,  about the tech we were learning and so on. It was absolute Shit"
Fuck him. Didn't anyone from college staff oppose this?,"Nope,  these shitty MF professors were laughing at it."
Spineless,Yes
Okay then sleep now match gonna start later 😆,Yeah I should now.
Haha yes,Nice
I just hope RCB doesn't collapse.,Yeah me too
Let's see,Suyash was 🔥
Yeah. Performing when it matters.,Yes
And also Rajat is back so.....,Yeah
Haha yes,Osm he is
It was always 2 or 3.,Yeah yes
This season has been great 😃,Yeah
For Java observation you said we need to write the programs given in class right? Can I write random sample ones or the same one given in class?,In class programs
Okay,You can add some sample ones too
Alright,OK bro
https://youtube.com/shorts/ufZ_u188GAM?si=MklKimy5M_dJ12lt  It's getting crazy out there.....,"Now we can generate in simple prompts,  it is very much real and accurate now."
Oh. Okay.,Yes
I was learning java and found this. Check the code -   public class Main{ public static void main(String[] args){ double pi = 22 / 7; System.out.println(pi); } }  What will be the output?,3
Only in dynamically typed languages don't have this issue.,Ok'
it actually divides in int and then converts to double. So output will be 3.0. I never knew this.,Yeah right
So even c has the issue.,Oh I haven't knew this
all static typed languages has this issue.,Oh okayy
"No, I'm well behind on Java so learning it.",Ok
Need to work on react too. So probably no project this weekend.,Oh Ok
for movies?,That day it was 20% acurate
Help me remember it. Again.,"Actually after the summary generation,  we are trying to generate questions on the next concept related to the summary to the user."
and it was giving true and false?,"So,  user can know more about the topic"
That one?,Yeah
any examples?,"It is generating questions on the present summary itself that too really basic,  now I have to find out the related concepts  that are ahead of the summary and generate questions, if the user wants to know about the next part like that"
How did you do that?,"It is a long process,  I will  explain you in the class."
"oh, okay.",We need to install sentence transformers library and with the user of keyword we have to embed it into a question
Must be frustrating.,Yep
Vikram showed me his project. I suggested him to add some features.,Nope
Yes.,"No, not solo, let me reach out people."
The scaring part? 🥲,Haha
"You have already learnt some stuff and ahead of them, right?","I have learnt in the range of 30-40%, still need to learn more"
Maybe you are expecting too much from them. Others will never learn even half of what you will learn.,Maybe yes
I'm 100% sure.,"I am planning to ask Vivek, he is ahead of me in ML so"
Hmm. Just hope they don't rely entirely on chatgpt or ai tools to code.,yes right
Let's see how much we we would have achieved by the end of the semester.,Yeah We should do bro
Very less - 15 mins by walk.,OK bro
Why so suddenly? Or it was planned before?,Planned before
"From Dattatreya temple, you need to go through the link road and to mantri Mall.",OK
I need to go through the link road. Cause my home is nearer than Dattatreya.,Oh OK
https://youtube.com/shorts/xEYTdQrrI1w?si=MqdX9psHGzbyI0os,😂😂
hi anything important today?,No bro
Yes,Ok
"I worked on the backend for the AI project. But I have some doubts, i will clear it with you tomorrow.",Ok
For now there are 4 tables/collections,oh ok
Any updates on the project?,<Media omitted>
What about the frontend?,He won't do I think
I'm leaning the react and designed the login and logout page for practice.,"I have messaged d him on Saturday, he said he is busy on some other things right now. So,  we need a guy from your FSD class"
"I will follow the 2nd sem, and learn react, express and mongo.",OK bro nice
I don't know anyone who is ahead in doing those. Lecturer is still doing the basics of react.,OK
What are your requirements? You need express and mongo also to store data? Python also needed to connect and store. I want to know the requirements.,"Will you get time, bcoz u are working on your network project"
"I'm going to learn all these for my project also, that's why.",Mongo needed as we know and python is almost done.
"We need python code to connect to db for all tables. And also to store data from app to db, how do you want it? Will you use java or python is needed. Storing files also need python code.",OK bro
"If I have questions later, i will ask.","Jdbc connects to the database,  which in turn connects to its tables"
So no need of python right?,No I think
Okay got it,"I was good at react,  but I forgot everything,  and now I am seeing my react project."
True,"Yeah, I haven't asked him."
Okay plan however you want. And share it with me.,OK about?
Learning full stack.,OK.
Like how?,To take up a project from YouTube or any platform like learn on the spot and implement. Only small front-end projects
It's actually the right way to learn things. That's why I jumped to design login and sign up pages. Even sir said to work on small projects.,Yes
"React was hard to understand by theory. But i got some of the basic things. Like importing, exporting, including and toggling between pages, variables like that.",Nice bro great start
Yeah,Ok
Oh,Because I can't leave my comfort here <This message was edited>
I can do neither.,Haha
"I know my limit that's why. I don't want to take over work. If I get the job I want, I would easily leave the college halfway.",Hmm makes sense
Job?,Nope 😂
Great,"Yeah I have to make it shorter,  I will do it  ."
"If you bring your laptop someday, show me these things.","Yeah yeah sure,  my brother uses it in the day times,  but I will try to bring this week definitely"
"Take your time. Whenever you can, show me that time.",Yeah it's just like adding a simple endpoint to the ML model <This message was edited>
Okay got it,Yeah.
Okay,"PDF,  audio,  image,  text ,  YouTube summariztion all done"
Is node js have a role in your project?,Now comes the main part contextual summarization
Alright,OK
That's the main thing,Yeah
For the python lab? What do I need to do? Sample programs again?,"Nope,  lab programs"
But I'm still a beginner.,It's there in the record
We can use chatgpt?,Yeah everybody are doing that.
Okay,"I will Side by learn react to help you because there are many features,"
Alright,It's OK I will join hands with you
Let's talk about it tomorrow,Yeah OK bro
Hi the setup is on.,I have to find its usecase
Bots are those things which do specific tasks like an assistant as you mentioned.,OK I am confused right now.
Do research on it.,Yeah I will get to know more about it and will get back to you
"It's simple - bots do certain tasks, like navigating, helping users regarding the application, like that.",Yeah yeah
Okay,"I want to design a persona kinda thing. Like  a GF, doctor etc."
Then we need the thing which you are using for text summarization. And Train them.,"Yeah,  let's see"
"I will build the logic part, you do the request and response thing.",Yeah OK bro
But wouldn't it be better if the frontend is done first?,Yeah right it will be good
Because it's not the core feature in your project. So if the frontend is done first then we can add this as an extra feature.,WTF is happening in the match bro
Livingstone our hope 🙏🏻,Yeah he need to hit.
He will 😅. I think,Yeah
Projector,Ok
"""desperate situations need desperate measures""",Yes
That's why we need something special from bowlers.,Yeah
Any average bowlers can defend that. Good bowlers should defend tonight's target.,Yes
It's after all a final. Early wickets will put them under pressure. So Bhuvi should step up today. <This message was edited>,Yes. But everyone in reading bhuvi easily. Let's see
Sadly yes. But it's desperate times so he should find desperate solutions. Hazel can't do it alone.,Yeah. Our boys will do well  . LFG
Punjab are inexperienced and they are chasing in the finals so our bowlers should use it.,Yes
My projector is not the best. So it's late couple of seconds than TV. At every wicket they are bursting crackers. And after it bursts I'm seeing the wicket 😭 <This message was edited>,Haha 😀
You watching on TV?,Yes bro
Crazy things happening in Bengaluru. Public screenings and free food are being provided.,Yeah here too.
There is one near my home too.,OK
It now depends on our pacers.,"In our stadium,  a theatre like screen was arranged and I was there until 10"
Oh 😍,KP gave everything
It has become a festival. They just need to live up to our expectations.,Yeah yeah right
He did in 2017 final also for MI,Yeah
"Hazel, Bhuvi and dayal had 2 each.",He was great
Still experience matters.,Yea
Fuck they are bringing punjab back in the game.,Yep
None of them had a bad day today.,Yeah maybe bhuvi was Lil bit expensive
No way. That's not expensive at all. Given the context of the game.,Yeah I remember
Okk.,Yes
Oh yeah.,Yeah
Fuck they are in the game 😢,This Shashank wasn't in form the entire season
One of the RCB curses,😔
Stoinis coming ☠️,Yeah this guy hits
Bhuvi should save us from him,1st ball six
It's Bhuvi time for m.o.m,"If Shashank gets out,  then we are winning the cup"
Yeah.,Devilliers and Gayle in the stadium
<Media omitted>,Yeah yeah
AB is looking to invade the ground if we win.,Yeah he is
Views,Oh oh 🔥
❤️,Bro kohli
He is humbled.,Saw his happy tears after a long time
Yeah 🥹,Send the pic you have put in you status <This message was edited>
Virat one right?,Yee
<Media omitted>,😂
More will come 🔥,Yes
And also posted Ee sala cup namde.,Yeah I saw his post
UK ex-pm was in the ground to support RCB.,Yea
More and more and more will come.,Yessssd
Our boys have done something here. The police siren is loud. Probably beating some haters 😭,Oh Shit
It's loud here. They are having rallies 😅,"Woah,  you can't sleep today"
For real. The sirens are still going on.,Oh bengaluru won't be silent tonight
I can't stop using Twitter and liking their posts. Brain rot happening here,Yeah I am scrolling
Mallya too congratulated 😝,Oh nice
<Media omitted>,Haha nice nice
Didn't come?,No bro Woke up now
Slept at?,3:30
I slept at 3,U?
But came,Yeah
"Our college is close to it, even I could have gone to it. But nothing more important than one's own life.",Yeh
Is it working?,I am still figuring out how to implement it.
"Okay, let me know if you find any.",OK
So it's better to find alternatives. Unless you get funding you cannot buy those kinds of servers. <This message was edited>,Vikram haven't used any ML model
"That's my point, he doesn't, that's why he has hosted easily on that server but you can't host on that normal server.",Hmm
If your project needs good specs  I meant.,Got it
But it has its own issues. Until you get funding you need to use that way only.,Hmm yeah! My back-end work will complete within next week I hope so
Okay.,I lost my touch in react
"But still if you start now, you can pick it up faster than us.",I will brush up the basics and will help soon
Okay.,Ok
So tell us about it. What we are doing to do. We are 3 in members.,Ok
Okay.,so need to start frontend soon
"Oh, when?",SE ma'am . I think you are absent on monday
For you specifically? Or in general?,I have informed you about the interface thing
Cause I'm not done with the frontend so early.,Every group needs to have documentation and frontend of their projects like one in a group <This message was edited>
Your AI project,"If we have gave name means,  we have to do documentation on that only."
How much time we got?,OK
Ok,Gave 80% of today to Leetcode.
"It's already June, no signs of companies. Are they lying?",LinkedList and Recursion
Oh,No idea.
"I couldn't learn this for my sudo solver. I didn't know how the recursion worked, so I didn't work on it 😞 It's a great concept <This message was edited>",Very tough to understand
Oh,Yeah
It keeps on backtracking until the right output. Will use huge memory too.,Yes
let me read for a min,Have you read both the summaries
Okay so you chose agile vs waterfall model as next query. Am I correct?,Nope.
Is that summary not based on related queries but based on keywords then?,First one is Software engineering methods with waterfall model.  In Second summary I have asked about Agile model and it compares with the previous waterfall model
Can you share the inputs for each summary. It would be easier to understand. I'm bit confused.,"Yeah right,  after the first sumarry generation if the user wants to get answers about specific answers to the generated questions, then he can give that question as a prompt  and can get answers"
You got this from 1st input's summary?,"Nope,  this is a separate input"
Okay then I'm not getting it. Explain me tomorrow.,Ok
It would be easier if build using this existing templates.,I have switched off my laptop.
No problem.,Can these files open in Mobile
Turn on the desktop node for a better view.,Nope after extracting I am getting no files found
There is nothing inside?,No
Okay then better you view in the laptop only. <This message was edited>,Ok
Have you seen it?,Extracted the ZIP
Search for index.html and open it in a browser.,Ok
It's like a reference for us to select a particular design and use it.,Ok got it
See and let me know.,<Media omitted>
If you use this your project would look polished.,"Ok, let's try this."
Ok,Ok bro
Done,Can you see the comparision in the 2nd input with the first input
"In my understanding, you gave non primitive data types as input. It compared to the previous one and it generated summary using the keywords of the previous one.",Yes
It's working fine then.,Ok
Only .pdf file right?,Yes
I will work around the python bot and see.,I think we need python for this
For accepting certain types of files?,Yes
Yes.,But I dont know whether we can connect C code through flask to Java <This message was edited>
Even java too,But I am not sure.
I'm sure of it.,"Ok, see how we can connect it via flask?"
You worry about other stuff.,Ok. You take care of that.
Alright,Ok.
There?,Yes bro
I was working on setting up Nginx server and using CI/CD pipelines using git and github. Now I know how github and git works for setting up projects. You needed to know right. I can explain you in the class.,"Nice bro,  I am eager to know about this"
Alright.,OK
good just need ssh then.,<Media omitted>
"I use linux one in command line, So I'm not sure about this.",OK
"Even for react this is being used in the class, maybe this is the one.",OK
Looks like it is - Git Bash is a command-line tool that emulates Git CLI for Windows and offers Unix command line features.,Oh OK
any updates on project?,"Today I was completely working on implementing the contextual logic and recommendation system logic in all the services like YouTube video summarizing,  audio,  image and in PDF too."
Success?,Yes all of them did well and I got some issue in YouTube summarizing. Because both audio and YouTube summarizer uses the same port to run via flask and some logic issue in YouTube summarizer.
Okay,Changed the port numbers that's it.
"Okay, network related so got curious 😅",Haha OK
I do.,I should enable it.
Alright. You are not thinking about it right?,"Yeah,  because the OCR engine I am using is more powerful"
is you laptop up?,Nope
"Okay then you test it later, i will send you a pic. test that pic and let me know the output/summary.",OK
<Media omitted>,OK
How much time it takes to process?,OK I will let you know tomorrow
"Oh, good.",OK
"For 3rd, it needs information all denominations of a sect under a religion. Most complex then previous ones.  It's like level 1-3 You can add this for testing purpose also in documentation. <This message was edited>",ok
"Wow, summary correct for 1st image. I'm impressed with the queries too. 🤯","Yeah, the OCR engine is quite good."
laptop running?,Nice yeah.
Run the 3rd too and let me know. I'm interest in that one too.,ok wait
Okay.,"{ ""keywords"": [ ""Protestant denominations"", ""Congregationalist"", ""Methodist"", ""Anabaptist"", ""Salvation Army"", ""Lutheran"", ""Reformed"", ""Presbyterian"", ""Seventh-Day Adventist"", ""Protestantism diversity"" ], ""summary"": ""This appears to be a diagram listing various Protestant denominations, including Congregationalist, Methodist, Anabaptist, Salvation Army, Lutheran, Reformed, Presbyterian, Seventh-Day Adventist, and potentially others with partially obscured names. It highlights the diversity within Protestantism.\n"", ""prompt"": ""What would you like to know more about?"", ""relatedQueries"": [ ""Okay, here are 5 relevant user questions that explore the key concepts of the provided summary more deeply:"", ""**What are the key theological differences that distinguish these denominations from one another, and what historical events led to their formation as separate groups within Protestantism?** (This question delves into both the doctrinal reasons and historical context behind the denominations.)"", ""**To what extent do these denominations share common ground in their core beliefs, despite their differences, and what are some examples of doctrines or practices they generally agree upon?** (This question explores the underlying unity within Protestantism, contrasting it with the diversity.)"", ""**How has the relationship between these Protestant denominations evolved over time - have there been periods of greater cooperation, conflict, or convergence, and what factors have influenced these shifts?** (This question focuses on the dynamic nature of inter-denominational relationships.)"", ""**Beyond theological and historical distinctions, how do these denominations differ in their approaches to worship style, church governance, and social engagement?** (This question broadens the scope to include practical aspects beyond pure doctrine.)"", ""**What is the current membership size and geographic distribution of these denominations globally, and how are they adapting to contemporary social and cultural changes?** (This question explores the current status and future trends of these denominations.)"" ] },"
"The questions are good, letting user choose the specific question to pick. Keyword's also good.",Ok
"Yes, we will do that one too.",Good then.
Using github we can easily.,OK
Oh,Not for image and PDF
"I don't know how flask works, let me find out how to run this on any devices.",OK
I'm not sure about it. So I would give it a try. If I understand it i will proceed otherwise i won't. It's kinda off 50-50. So don't keep much hope on it.,OK
Build it,And we can send a tailored message like notification to the user that what his /her partner's mood.
Notification through the same app?,"OK, I will start building it from scratch like training dataset to complete thing manually"
Okay let me know then,Let's think about this
It's the right way. Like how you get notification if i send a message from the WhatsApp.,Hmm I need to think
Okay,OK <This message was edited>
Check out for wit.ai,Ok
Noise cancellation with 42 ANC is the model to search,As of now I have Boat earbuds bro.
Oh okay 👍🏻,"After this goes faulty, I will buy that"
Alright.,OK
Macbook m4 selling at 91k 🤑,"Oh , price got less"
It's great deal,OK. Then planning to buy?
If it was 90 rupees i would buy 🙏🏻😢,Haha OK.
"Yesterday night, it was low as 75k it seems.","Oh really,  how is that possible?"
They offer at low prices for a small time,OK
"One time, from instamart, they gave away a free 50000. Because of a bug. Many tried but they got less. Only one got full use of 50k. I got 50 rupees 😢 Some of them got 10k <This message was edited>",Oh really OK
Yeah,OK
Send me the code once you're done.,OK
Research methodology is that true today is the last?,I don't believe them.
Haha okay 👍🏻,OK
I honestly didn't expect that reply from you 😭,What happened?
I don't know in what way sent it. I read it like you slapped their face 🤣🤣,Haha 😂.
So this week what do you guys did in Java lab?,Actually some day someone said that we need to complete it within 4th sem.
Yeah,"Labset 2,3 and some programming Examples ma'am gave in class"
Alright,OK bro
Need to from this weekend,OK bro
Haha must be irritating 🤣🤣,"Yeah,  she posts childy content everyday"
😭,Oh active guy 😂 <This message was edited>
Haha I doubt that was sent by his P.A,😂
Are they mentioning the date for the exam?,No
"I need a date, that's why",I am thinking about this
"Okay if you do and get a date let me know. If they give time, it will be helpful to prepare if it's compulsory to do today itself.",OK I will let you know
Would be a great help.,OK
Are you paying?,"I have paid,  but I got no confirmation message or anything"
I'm just worried what if they give a slot tomorrow itself?,I don't know what to say
Okay share me the link,https://online.vtu.ac.in/student/my-course/Introduction-to-Research-Research-Methodology
"I haven't completed the course se, so can I still pay?",Yeah you can
<Media omitted>,<Media omitted>
Share this link,"Oh,  then you may have to select one option from the above image you sent"
Okay let me see,"After payment,  the website got closed <This message was edited>"
Check ma'am's message.,I have applied for the first one
Is there any option to cancel it?,Don't know
"I saw both, that's why I got the doubt.",Did you find out the 2nd course?
Yes,"If yes,  then where?"
Check if you can access it,No
What's it showing?,"who have completed the course, applied for the first one"
"And enroll it, it will come under your learning.",OK
Can't pay for both for sure.,How to check my learning?
Was there a quiz for you when you booked?,<Media omitted>
Oh,Ok
Got it?,Share yours?
Are you trying to pay for it?,"I have paid for it, and again it is showing the apply for exam option,  I don't know about what to do"
I'm not paying too.,Ok
My ma'am.,"OK,  let's clarify tomorrow"
Right.,I got 500 rs discount bcoz of category when I paid
Because of this i haven't slept yet 😶,I think karma wants me to pay again
I don't know about that. But there might be a way to cancel it. And it must be hidden.,OK
"Like how they hid signin, courses and user menu.",Yeah
"I paid now, got the seatings in the next week.",OK bro nice
Did you get that too?,No
Oh,I may get Lil bit later
Maybe,OK
Okay,Yeah
9223866666,https://internship.aicte-india.org/internship-details.php?uid=SU5URVJOU0hJUF8xNjU1MTkyNjk0NjBlMjc2YjM0NTM3NQ==&level=NA==
"I'm curious to know what was talked about me, in the lab? 😅 Python ma'am don't look at me while teaching in class. Because not answering viva in the DSA test 😅  I'm still wondering how Vivek knew.",Nice to hear
Yeah it looks good. I need to fill in my details and will apply.,I think he knew the concept. They just said it was a nice concept and complex too.
https://unstop.com/o/0rtBXYW?lb=nRWXyx0N&utm_medium=Share&utm_source=shortUrl  I don't know if it's useful but they mentioned data structure and maths. And also the intern gets paid around 40k. I got this notification from unstop.,Mam didn't even how the concept works
I bet no one would 🤣🤣 I'm thinking I should probably give a presentation in the near future about my project. But I need to complete more phases.,"Saw this nd got to know the interview experience too,  they ask Dynamic programming and greedy techniques and trees,  graphs more. I haven't practiced even a single question from this"
No time given to practice?,Nope
With 40k they want more i guess at the very beginning. Okay leave let's just keep working on what we have.,Need more time to understand the concepts and to solve questions need even more time
Good 👍🏻  If only we could partners who could compliment We could do a lot more.  We have ideas but not manpower.,Yeah back-end is almost over. You shared were right.
"Okay, good. I have contributed something 😅",I want to implement all file upload options
Do I need something? Storing the file in db right? Can you refresh me the idea.,"Yes let's go. We thought of bringing someone for frontend,  but 😂"
🤣,"Right now we have only PDF upload option, so we need to add all file upload options. Storing files in db won't be that useful I think"
Then what to do? For it?,Oh oh oh OK. Which girl? 😂
Haha Will tell when it's time 😉,We need to work on the backend to enable all file upload options
"Hmmm. Okay let me keep a target, probably next month.",Even I don't know let's figure out.
I need to practice a lot. I never gave a presentation against a crowd. Only in video calls.,OK bro I will let you know
Okay then i need to go. Also think about SE.,OK let's go
I will also help.,OK bro
Just research about how it's done. We can later discuss who does what in the class.,OK
And we will do the necessary.,Yeah understood
Going to the placements?,No
No I have my reasons.,Yeah they were
Hi,hae bro
Guide me,Crowded one seems to be difficult.
I have no experience 😔,"Like to interact continuously or some romantic convos. If we go to crowded place, then the person sitting beside you will stare at you people. Privacy issue"
"Surely experience, i can see that.",Who me?
Just for future use. So nothing special 😊,Can't believe
It's the truth! I will tell you if I ever go.,"Haha, some good and bad old memories"
"See, that's the experience 😄",haha no.
I found out that there is something called uncensored ai.,What is that?
"Other AI probably won't, especially against Israel.",Oh nice
I have a doubt.,?
It's alright. But did you tried to install the ssh?,I have slept yesterday evening and got up today   at 4
Okay try today then,"Probably I won't get the laptop today also. I may get after 2 days, I will try then"
"main technologies are AI, machine learning, cloud computing, data engineering (snowflake,tableau, power BI), Dev ops, networking",Nope
Oh okay. I got confused.,Ok
For git.,"Probably I won't get the laptop today also. I may get after 2 days, I will try then"
Okay,In class?
Yes,Ok
Yeah,OK I am coming directly to lab
Oh why?,Got up now so
Okay,OK bro
"If you give a file path (for now) it checks whether it has ""pdf' at the very end. If not it will execute the else part.",OK
Then use that only.,What about other file types?
"What all the other types, can you list it?","No. PDF is already done. I have asked you about other ones like word,  csv,. Txt"
So we are gonna take almost all file types. Then no need for validations. The types of files we need to take.,Yes
And does spring boot don't have components for those files?,Nope
Is there any other way out?,Which one? Gemini
Yes,No  it can't do
It's gonna take forever.,"OK, but we may not have other options. I don't know"
ppt and .pptx - Apache POI .csv	- OpenCSV .txt	 - Java I/O,OK I will try to see how it works
"Okay, java is better in these situations.",Ok
"For smaller slides python works well but when the file gets bigger java needs to handle it. As your application is a real world application so it would make sense, we can expect more size.",Yes right
Hi are you doing any DBMS project with Vijay?,He asked and I didn't say no.
So I will work on a different project for DBMS.,OK
Classes at 11:30 right?,"Bro I have asked him. He said that others have formed team like his friends,  so he said to join with me is the only option."
Okay.,2 maybe
Okay that's better. Saying no for his request would be in bad taste.,Yeah
Does he or you have any project ideas?,Email automation
You are storing data using MySQL then?,Actually I'm planning to add time intervals to auto send mails.
Once confirm it with ma'am. Whether she will accept it or not.,Project?
Have you submitted the title or anything?,"Anyway I am  using MySQL right , so she will accept maybe"
Okay.,"No,  not yet"
Okay.,"OK then let's work on both the projects now,  if she accepts 3 in a team then we can go with yours"
Okay but ask her as soon as possible. Before submitting the title.,Ok will try today.
yesterday which lab?,Python
You got the yellow book?,Upto 7
7 as in are they giving sample programs for test?,"Yeah I have, will reach college within 11:10"
Okay,Do you have test today
"Yes, today is python lab for us.",OK bro
what does this program should do?,It adds an element in an already sorted list and if not sorted it sorts at the end
Okay,Okay
Okay,"Hi bro. If you are buying yellow books,  buy an extra one for me."
Didn't went to college,Coz tomorrow I will not come and Friday society will be closed
Any test?,Every Friday society will be closed right
Any tests?,"No, Monday we have tests right so"
Is that confirmed?,Yeah every teacher is saying that
Okay.,OK bro take cash
Okay,OK
What's this?,Like it has some crazy automations that can solve some ral world problems <This message was edited>
Saw some,Many have done already and We can get resources from this spreadsheet to learn and implement
You already have a good project why change now?,"No, I am not changing, just found this useful, so sent to you to have a glance"
You are trying to incorporate some of the ideas into your project. Am I right?,"Not thought yet, If I get something interesting then i will add for sure"
For the AI project.,Yeah I should
What was the issue for video generation? No api or need a good pc?,"Yeah, but I dont know how to implement"
Okay. What about image generation? Does it also have both issues?,Havn't researched about it
Okay.,"But these features , can be gamechangers"
How will you do it then?,I have to learn  more about this and I have to do this for sure
Need funding probably.,Yeah for the API costs.
You need something to sell.,Yeah bro I should.
Okay,Ok bro
I'm stuck with some function,In college or ?
One for you right?,Oh shit ok
Lectures kept saying tomorrow is a holiday as they are not coming. Don't know why no official confirmation is not given yet.,OK who and all?
Python ma'am. And i think vidya ma'am.,Oh really
No way,OK bro then
Okay,Started SE?
What to start?,Preparation for tests
I'm not gonna write python and Java tests,Why?
Yes,"Oh, he will give on Monday. <This message was edited>"
I don't plan on getting scolding again from him.,Hmm OK
"Classes were over at 12:10. Everyone went home, I was there till 13:30.",Oh really
From our class. I didn't see anybody else. Only the B and C section were there as they had classes in the afternoon.,Such a bullshit he is.
That's why I won't play his games anymore. They think they control me with marks.,Hmm right.
After his message I thought I shouldn't attend any tests. But Swetha ma'am has put only for the respective subjects. So I will attend others.,OK
"Hi I know it's too late, but i won't be coming tomorrow. So you may have to secure a yellow book from others. I will make up to you someday in some other way.",Oh OK bro
Hi,Hi bro
No where,"Ok, are you fine?"
Yes I'm,Ok
Yes,Ok bro
Does that mean it can store history even after logout or closing the browser?,"Not right now,  but can make it happen"
Good.,Yeah
Like features,"After every summary generation,  I need to add a statement like you want to take a quiz on this and two buttons displaying yes and no and the main focus will be on UI and also after the quiz,  we need to show why the answers attempted were wrong with a reason. So this may add some solid grip and users can learn from it"
Yes that's the whole point right? Users need to learn from their mistakes. Else users have to Google it again.,Yeah this may beat google forms maybe
Any score tracking mechanism? Not permanent but temporary?,We may add it
Okay,Yeah
Was working dbms project So got comfortable with api's in python. It's time for quiz,AIzaSyBSX9XPAbUumITM5Re-_8pkLFd0VBGE6AY
I will start by understanding the requirements then code it,"package com.summarizer.project.service;  import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value; import org.springframework.http.*; import org.springframework.stereotype.Service; import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;  import java.util.*;  @Service public class GeminiApiService {  @Value(""${gemini.api.key}"") private String apiKey;  private static final String GEMINI_API_URL = ""https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash:generateContent"";  public String getSummary(String text) { RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();   Map<String, Object> message = new HashMap<>(); message.put(""parts"", Collections.singletonList(Collections.singletonMap(""text"", ""Summarize briefly:\n"" + text))); message.put(""role"", ""user"");  Map<String, Object> payload = new HashMap<>(); payload.put(""contents"", Collections.singletonList(message));  HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders(); headers.setContentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON);  HttpEntity<Map<String, Object>> request = new HttpEntity<>(payload, headers);  // Fix the URL properly by adding ?key= String finalUrl = GEMINI_API_URL + ""?key="" + apiKey;  ResponseEntity<Map> response = restTemplate.exchange( finalUrl, HttpMethod.POST, request, Map.class);  try { Map content = (Map) ((Map) ((List) response.getBody().get(""candidates"")).get(0)).get(""content""); Map part = (Map) ((List) content.get(""parts"")).get(0); return part.get(""text"").toString(); } catch (Exception e) { return ""Failed to summarize: "" + e.getMessage(); } }   public List<String> extractKeywords(String text) { String prompt = ""Extract the top 5-10 keywords from this text.

oh god,Going to college  tomorrow?
yes,"Java's code always looks complex, but once we get in it's easy to understand."
"Okay then I will try directly in python, difficult to analyse all these code.",you can stop Above the generate keywords function to just call the API
"Python function to get data from api  def get_info(name): #get data from api url = f""{base_url}&t={name}"" response = requests.get(url)  if response.status_code == 200: movie_data = response.json() if movie_data.get(""Response"") == ""True"": #print(movie_data) return movie_data else: return None else: print(f""Failed to retrieve data {response.status_code}"")",Nice
what are these?,"No, wait a minute"
how can i read it?,but unable to upload that file
used react?,Yes
Even I don't know how to share react one. It's okay just shared the screenshot,<Media omitted>
"need dependencies, paths to run",<Media omitted>
that's why share the ss 😅,Output one ? or code file's?
output,Ok then give 5 mins
okay,Do you know how to use flask ?
no,"Ok bro, every IT company which have been using Python as their backend using Fast API or Flask API to wrap up the data and enabling them to run in a port so it can be connected by any other frontend or other backend services."
"I have to learn it definitely, will look at it some time later. Can you tell me what I need to do in flask for quiz?",You need to write your python logic code inside flask's template and run that's it
So do I need to learn flask first before coding? inside flask's template do the syntax change?,"No, it won't"
"But, I will probably finish in 2 more days 😅",Which one?
movie database,"Nope, will you write remedials?"
No,DOn't want inernal marks?
Not studied anything so I can't write anything,Both Java mam and DBMS asked about you while giving yellow books
I will focus on projects more from now on,Nice
What did they say?,"Like, Why you didn't attend tests and why not attending classes ? <This message was edited>"
Oh,I said nothing
In last 13 days I came only one day that too left before lab on monday 🤣 <This message was edited>,"Haha, I think that's why they asked"
"Worked on UI too for my network project, from scratch using bootstrap only","Ok nice, I wont be coming tomorrow <This message was edited>"
Okay,"Nice bro, what about backend?"
"I'm stuck with it, not able to understand what is best for my requirements",Oh Ok bro
That's why till then I will build UI,Ok bro
"I know the dataflow, i'm not stuck with but with encryption, algorithm, networking that part. data flow is simple user logs in creates a group and then posts in it. Nothing complex in data flow, so UI can be designed for it. I'm stuck with netwroks, Which is very hard to understand and then implement it.",Ha Ok bro
I can't figure out it.,"Ok, yeah when we fully involve in it we may get an idea , that may work <This message was edited>"
It's just to complex to get help from AI or don't know any lecturers are there to help me.,How about sharath sir?
It's just too hard with my current knowledge,Ok
"maybe if I had computer networks this sem it would have been helpful, no use in learning full stack for my project as well as career",Yeah right.
That's why able to do other projects like chat and movie database can easily be done as we already have classes for it,yeah.
"It's like you learning AI with no subject, imagine that 🥲",Yeah understood
If i get my subjects in 3rd sem then this project may complete,Ok
Will apply for internship?,Ok bro
now?,Have you checked that company ?
No I didn't,It is shit
scam then? 🤣,"The form mam shared, was the company's first post in linkedin <This message was edited>"
Oh,Maybe a just started startup
Who knows,"Dont know, why my VS code sucks."
why?,Haha
"Something happened with my react also in VS code some days, solved that but lost time because of it,",Oh ok it sucks really
"Yes, figuring out these things really demotivates to work on projects.",Haha
Okay I will let you know when I'm done with the quiz. probably tomorrow I will finish.,Ok bro
Okay,<Media omitted>
"Looks good, the question page?",<Media omitted>
If I give the backend logic then you can make the questions page dynamic? to retrieve all questions right?,yeah I need that
Is that just a template page created? How did you got results?,"wrap your python code in a flask template. That's enough, to call the backend i"
Okay,Ok bro
I can understand,Yes
"Which one are we supposed to do? College work, projects, or career related things?","Fuck them bro, they are always making us to concentrate on studies."
True,Yeah fuckn bitches they are
Need to somehow move to next semester. To get ourselves free time.,Yes  right
"They make our lives hard every way possible. I mean even for tests we have to write so much for them. Hard work on everything, but no guarantee that we will get a job if we do that.",Right
What's this?,Project title
Okay you can,Does the name sounds good or do you have any options on the name?
What does it mean?,what? Crisply.ai?
"Like for your project, how do you see your project in that word.",It reduces the given content sharp and crisper like Informative with less content.
Good then proceed,"Low quantity, high informative"
Got it 👍🏻,"Ok, then"
Home,went to collge?
I came home. Python ma'am called out me and Vikram while we were escaping but we came out anyway,Like what kind of?
Don't know,Ok
Join what?,To SE project
We are already 4 right?,"No, 3"
"Oh, no timma then?",They want to join our team
Oh,he asked for python project
In SE how many are we?,"No, he didn't spoke anything about joining for SE project"
Okay then will you add them?,"No, I think"
Don't they have yogesh?,He will not let in Shridhar
Oh Okk,"Vinay can join him, but he is Asking me to join in ours"
Will you trust their work 😅 <This message was edited>,"No definitely no, they will not do even"
Reject them.,Ok
I will do it with an api today.,Ok bro
We are not bad enough to reject them for no reason. I seriously doubt their work. So we can't do anything in it.,Yes right.
"Just tell them marks from it are important for us, so we can't take risks with them and reduce our marks.",Ok bro
5 in a group is seriously hard to manage especially when me and Varun don't talk with him. Then all managing responsibility will fall on you. So beware!!!,Hm yes bro right
What else do you expect from pebbles?,😃😅
<Media omitted>,Okay....
"I'm doing it anyway, because ours is a test app.","After generating questions ,  we can share it as a form or a web link."
Just letting you know about this,Yeah build it.
It's necessity <This message was edited>,I can't get it...
API only job is to generate questions based on requirements.,"Yeah we should do this way only,  I have done the same in Summarization project also"
"It's best for users they don't have to rely on AI, like how would you open the leetcode page to show problems to me. It's so quick instead of going to AI and feeding it inputs.","Yeah,  even an API can't do this,  because it generates contents and will not perform any storage,  retrieval functions,  even paid API also can't do this functions except generating"
Can be used not by our college but can be a real app,Yeah got the idea.
not even google works there,<Media omitted>
"My miss, I meant the ssh",<Media omitted>
"Plus we need net to push code to github, to use git commands",Not yet
which project you want to push?,"Ok, I will let you know after installing"
How much storage it takes?,<Media omitted>
Imagine trying to push this much with internet on college premises. 🥲🥲🥲,In parking space internet would be good.
Are you done with ssh?,Haha....not yet
If it doesn't work then we can see,Ok
for java lab what you guys did this week?,No bro let it finish
Okay,OK bro
labset?,OK
They treated as sample programs then?,Dont know about this
It's been a long time since I went. Done 3 labset is that correct or need to more?,"No, you need to do 3 more I think"
6 & 7 are servlets,"Anyway mam explained servlets, you guys have to do it i think\"
Okay,Yeah she said to do in the lab
Okay then,Ok bro
Classes at 8 right?,Yeah
Did you install?,Nope
Okay,Ok
That was for placements right?,Yes
- having an room where users can join by invite - where they can create/compete with each other on tests with timer and number of questions and difficult level to choose - results and scores and leader board will be real time.,"Sounds good bro, this will make the application more standard ."
There is a reason why battle royale games are so famous.,Oh OK nice
Need networks for this.,Oh OK then you are there for this.
Yes.,OK bro
Looks polished.,Yeah
It's getting complex day by day.,Oh OK
Movie db.,And I worked on the new tab option and the previous summaries displaying in a new tab once clicked.
Can you explain this a bit more.,Oh OK. Yes I have submitted long back
Oh okay i need to submit tomorrow.,OK bro
Okay so does that mean it won't store any previous queries or histories? We can proceed with a fresh start?  As we are using db to store summarise for context. We don't need this in the new tab right?,"It will be stored, each and every query's summary will be stored in the DB and used for contextual logic"
"I got the sidebar features, it's needed.","No,  in popular LLMs also the past summary will be stored even the new chat is clicked."
Oh,"I will get clear on this,  and I will decide whether to store or not"
"I'm also not sure, about how others have designed.",OK
Db,OK when did ma'am inform
I think Swetha ma'am said,"OK,  prepared?"
Yes,Oh OK
For?,Because I have to invest time on learning useful things rather than doing college stuff
Okay,Will be giving more time on DSA and projects.
Good for you.,"Yeah Because placements have been started right,  and I have started applying off campus too <This message was edited>"
Great. Which roles?,Now primarily focusing on ML roles and Back-end development.
Okay,Internships
Okay.,"OK bro,  I think I won't be coming tomorrow."
Leave on lab day?,Yeah bcoz I haven't missed python lab even a single day.
"For java, which was on 11th Friday before that I went to the 13th of June. Almost a month since I went.",Oh Oh 😀OK
Can you check for this link?,There is no captions
Okk,<Media omitted>
At least it's showing you the right title. For me it gave me the title of some other shorts and explained that video. 🤦🏻,Haha OK 😀
Yes,Have they explained anything about placements like importants or something?
Nothing,OK
Haven't given a thought to it yet.,OK bro
Prepared?,Preparing....bro.
😂,😂
<Media omitted>,Nope slept afternoon and I have started now
Just kidding,Yeah got that
Are they talking about api?,Maybe
For studying purpose,Oh OK
But check once if it's api it's cool,Yeah will check
How did it go?,Not yet started
Not even aptitude? <This message was edited>,No
Ok,We got fucked
What do you mean?,POST THE QUESTIONS WHAT U HAVE TAKEN PICTURES OR SCREEN SHOTS OF TODAY'S PLACEMENTS
No one asked?,"Have you seen the names that last bench Vikas,  santhosh and all"
I was shocked,For all the sections
It's pathetic.,"MF,  that msg I shared you was sent by seema mam,  even she knew and she is asking the screenshots of the questions"
Really,Yeah that too in the main group
If i was there i wouldn't have shown mercy. Fuck them.,What to do
This is unethical. Because of them many genuine people would have lost it.,Yeah right that's what I am worried about
"What will they do in the interviews? They will flunk it, sub humans!??",Even Vinay got selected many have used chatgpt
That's what happened.,Yeah
That's what I was seeing. Why them but not people I know.,Hmm yes
If this is the procedure in the college then better you apply off campus. The role which suits you.,Yes
Leave them. Try on your own. We don't want in with unethical methods.,Yeah right
Just focus on projects that's the way for us. Let the pebbles be happy with their methods.,Yeah
Coming today?,No bro
Only two classes for us.,I got up very late just now
Yes,Oh OK
Don't know,OK bro
Why have they having shortlisted for EPAM?,Based on degree marks
Your name is there?,Yes
Then it's not based on degree marks,Bcoz u didn't apply bro
Yes,On that I asked about resume right
So they don't know my marks,Ha yes yes
Fresher's problem.,Yes
Even for basic jobs they need to move.,Hmm yes
After the quiz I will work one on java then that's all. No more projects. I will work on the network solely.,OK bro
and can you tell me about spring boot? is it similar to servlets? and why you chose spring boot over servlets?,Questions to prepare for remedial tests
really? no use of it?,"Uses are there,  but you know it lacks some features and it needs us to write more boilerplate code"
I read it as low-level and high-level of servlets and spring boot respectively.,"When we run the application, spring defaultly uses tomcat to run"
You don't specify which to run? Can you specify it?,"Maybe both, but spring uses tomcat"
Okay,"Yeah this tells that servlets lacks most of the features,  so spring overcame it."
Okay.,But if you want you can try servlets too
For java project I'm gonna do one using servlets. So wanted to know if there is something learning it.,OK
Guess I will keep it minimal not dive deep into it.,Okay
Don't know what others will say 😣,"Oh OK,   then...?"
Python ma'am was disappointed. As today was the test she left me. Dbms ma'am didn't agree to it.,Hmm
was working on quiz today. You have any updates?,Bro I am fucked up from yesterday.... I will start ASAP
They are not leaving me. I haven't even prepared I didn't expect this reaction from them. Usha ma'am won't leave me. Don't know what I'm gonna do.,Yeah
Let me ask you straight - is it because of the intership?,Absolutely yes
I heard only 5 were going to be selected nothing else.,OK
"got paid more too in capgemini whatever infosys was giving,",Hmm yes
"Just say ""Fuck them..."" and move on. It really pissed me off to. I observed Vinay's face today, there were no repercussions on his face. When they don't have it why should we have?",Yeah bro
let me know if you are doing something on test app?,Ok bro
If you didn't get it just let me know. I will frame the question based on it.,OK
"Please keep in mind - history, scores as well and other things basic features we need. We can think about room and all after wards.  We just need to know how to merge correctly. With basic features.",Anyway API returns answers in JSON format and using front-end tech I need to convert it into a proper format.
Api (json) -> front end  Is not gonna let us store in db and for further features.,Have you created rest APIs in the back-end
I don't know what it is.,"Because in rest API,  we have to pass the request parameters like userID, name, score and so on.... Then when we pass values in it (the response) then data will be easier for us to store in the db <This message was edited>"
Passing to where?,"Anyway you have to use flask to run it in a server,  so ..you can create there."
I don't understand anything.,Are you using functions?
In the code? Yes,Wait I will send my code snippet
I wanted to know what all the data you needed from the front side.,Then pass into it and define the controller above and inside the function you are defining the API right?
I have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. API's are not my area of expertise.,"UserID or name,  questions, timestamp , answers and scores..."
I have coded in python and am using the API to get the data. That's all.,Anyway you are using the API(gemini) right
I want the requirements.,"You knew the requirements better than me right like you got some good ideas to implement, so you video it now and send me the code I will figure out how I want to design the front-end"
As you already completed the design that's why I wanted inputs from your side but if you are okay with the changes I will proceed.,"1. Add user @app.route('/add_user', methods=['POST']) def add_user(): data = request.json user = User( user_id=data['user_id'], username=data['username'], avatar_url=data.get('avatar_url') ) db.session.add(user) db.session.commit() return jsonify({""message"": ""User added!""}), 201"
What is this?,Is it structured or unstructured data
Let me work on my part first I'm more confused now.,I will send the design within evening today.
Okay,OK
any interview today?,Just online test bro
from company side?,Yes
when will be the interview?,Friday
another company is coming right? this week? other than today's.,Yeah yeah
prepared?,Yeah bro
Is it a developing role?,Yeah
Alright.,Yeah I do
all the best.,Thanks bro
What is the forage certificate you have done? I saw in linkedIn,OK
Nothing good?,No use of that
Okay.,Yeah yeah
I got 2 of my certifications done in coursera. Updated it.,Oh nice bro
But 4 years old.,Paid or?
Have done many others but didn't save the certificates. 😣,Oh....
All paid by the company. We had access to coursera and plural sight - i have done many in pluralsight.,Oh OK bro.
I think I saw the student list.,Engg people were 300
It will be hard then.,Ok
What if they cheat again?,Yeah
Great then.,Yeah
Company name?,EPAM
Aight.,2 DSA questions to be solved in online test itself
Solve leetcode like problems?,Yes
Is it java based developing role?,27k stipend
Alright.,OK bro
Maybe allotted seats for each department.,Yeah maybe
We need to extremely well in aptitude to get their attention.,Oh OK
Let's see - timings of the test?,12-1:30 I think
Okay.,Don't know bro
"It must be there, they likely to test English too for communication skills.",Hmm maybe
This time the company looks more professional and serious with camera and all.,Yeah
Screenshot?,Ok
Search gemini ai pro for students,Ok
Good,I am gone
"They are not interested in MCA, so they are grouping like this.",yeah
Also the cgpa to limit more students.,Yes right
They are just not interested in MCA.,Yeah
Never thought our degrees are considered so low. I blame the college. They didn't give us enough time to upskill ourselves to compete with engineering students.,Yeah this is right
As ours is autonomous so they have kept the cap so high. Never seen companies ask that much.,Yeah yeah
Other than being near the other reason I joined this college is VTU university but they changed to autonomous as soon as I joined 🤦🏻,Oh Shit OK
I think it's low.,Yeah
If the role is the same for all departments then we might see no one selecting from our department too. Just a possibility. Have to see.,Hmm yes
I didn't try. Others were telling this too.,Yeah ok
check if it's okay?,Yeah bro fine.
only levels should be added.,Timestamp if needed
Those are different modules.,"Ok, what about no.of questions?"
already added.,"Ok, then for this , it is fine"
I have completed my work on twitter too.,Oh nice bro
This(test) is also done - need the code?,Yeah If it is done then send bro
"another thing to consider - it's better if we provide pre-defined topics, because user can enter like - ""1"", ""how to kill someone?"" - now this can raise errors from gemini side. As a test app we can provide wide variety range of options based on techs. Or even other studies related topics. I think this is how other quizzes are there too.",Right
Okay what about signup/login?,"Yeah I will do it, mostly the logic and design can be done using react only. So i will take care of it."
what tech will you use?,Mostly ReactJS
I'm not asking design part but backend part.,Validations and design will be taken care in frontend by me.  Backend need to compare and store and retrieve data in DB
when user enter data in webpage it needs to be stored in db right?,Right?
yes I'm talking about backend.,"Yes, we can use LocalStorage but it gets wiped off when we clear cache"
"Alright, when do you want to finish this project?",anyway yu are using it
we need to have a prototype before a date. <This message was edited>,You decide bro I am ready
We can keep updating afterwards.,"But give this week time for me, bcoz we need to give a presentation on ML project"
Any new updates on AI?,Anyway this is our personal project right so we can take time
Yes.,Not even touched from past week'
Shall I update this test project to my resume?,"It is almost complete, some design work is pending"
Okay.,"Yes bro, why you are asking me"
just confirmation.,"Ok bro, but if you want to add you can add"
"Sure,",Ok
Is this correct and enough?,"Yeah and the history should include the timestamp, Maybe Unique userID bcoz names can be duplicated and test question and answers and scores.."
"username is unique as in used to login like ""user_1"" , user names will be normal. only names will be duplicated but not username - username is used lot of where like telegram, twitter -so we can proceed with it rather than userid with numbers. And of course I will add other things. <This message was edited>",Ok bro then fine
"chars, num and only '_' underscore",Yeah ok
check,Ok
Okay good.,Ok
Without AI project - my project list exceeds 8 - I'm yet to do devops related project.,"Oh, that's plenty then.."
Yes that's why I decided to not work on anything else.,Ok
Started?,In the finishing line.
Yet to start?,Finished bro
The test? So fast?,No test bro
Then,Just pre placement talk
When it will be,Friday or Monday
Will the company be comin tomorrow for the aptitude?,It's OK bro
Okay,OK bro
I didn't get when you said it auto fills for servlet program. Where we are supposed to run it?,We have to right click and run on index.html
I left for home.,OK bro
No,OK bro
